    "justification":"This piece, \u201cPalace Yurt\u201d door panel (2008), was designed and made by Janice Arnold (b. USA, 1953), is from a larger installation, and is inspired by a traditional yurt door, which is essentially a carpet hanging over the doorway, but rolled up during the day. Typically it has some type of talismanic symbol to guard the home against evil. In this case, the piece shares the carpet\u2019s field\/border format, and comes with hand-braided cords to roll it up. The field is made by a contemporary felting technique called nuno felting, or felting through a woven substrate. In this case a loosely woven jute fabric gives a heavily textured surface, yet the piece is reminiscent of many 17th century laces in the collection. ",
