    "justification":"This bobbinet, manufactured by Swill Tulle U.K. PLC in 2004, and first designed in 2000, is used in a radar decoy which mimics the shape signature of the warship carrying it. The decoy is \u201cfired\u201d in the direction of a missile attack, and the missile locks onto it as the correct radar signature, rather than on the ship, which is further away. This means that the bobbinet provides electromagnetic shielding, is radar reflective and has conductive properties.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis silver-coated bobbinet, made of grey tulle, in comprised of fabric construction in which the weft yarn is looped diagonally around the vertical warp yarn to form an exceptionally stable hexagonal and clearly defined mesh.&amp;nbsp; The overall structure, which has been traditionally used in garments and accessories, is very lightweight, strong and sheer.
