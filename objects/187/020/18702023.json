    "description":"A dark green knit fabric with a varied and highly dimensional surface. Designed for the Ministry of Defense, United Kingdom, as a tank camouflage system called \"Quick Cam.\"",
    "justification":"This textile, which was designed in 1998 and manufactured in 2004 by Palmhive\u00ae Technical Textiles in England for the United Kingdom\u2019s Ministry of Defense, is comprised of knitted polyester and Lycra, and acts as three dimensional camouflage for tanks and other military equipment. It is produced in the traditional camouflage colors of green, black, and khaki. The sculptural and highly textured surface of this stretch fabric provides a more realistic disguise for the large equipment it conceals. This particular textile is very unique in that it is a knitted textile meant purely for industrial application. It demonstrates the ways in which fabrics can enhance safety, but it also shows the unintended intrinsic beauty of many industrial textiles.",
