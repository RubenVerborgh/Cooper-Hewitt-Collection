    "justification":"\nWith the creation of Eclat, a vibrant screen-printed textile for drapery and upholstery, Anni Albers delves into the art of screenprinting. This was a new textile-making direction for the designer brought about by experimentation with lithography in the mid-1960s. At that time her husband was asked to work at the Tamarind Lithographic Workshop in Los Angeles, where the head of the workshop, June Wayne, encouraged her to try lithography. She experienced a newfound expressive quality in the medium, and by the 1970s printmaking had become her primary focus. This knowledge of printmaking, as well as her passion for the techniques, no doubt impacted her subsequent textiles designs. Like other well-known works by Albers, the surface of this textile is animated by parallelograms that together create a dynamic three-dimensional effect. Eclat was intended as both a drapery fabric and for light upholstery applications, and was first available in a dozen colorways, however this particular version is executed primarily in a persimmon color.",
