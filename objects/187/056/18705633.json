    "description":"One layer of a knitted fabric is stretched under tension. A layer of polyester chiffon is layered on top. An adhesive is screen printed on in a pattern, permeating both fabric layers. Rayon fibers are sprinkled on and made to stand up as pile using an electric charge (flocking). The tension is released on the lower layer of fabric, causing the chiffon layer to pucker all around the flocked motifs. (a) is black with light green chiffon and black flocking; (b) is black with white chiffon and tan flocking.",
    "justification":"In Pedocal, Yoshihiro Kimura combines seemingly disparate materials to create an entirely new surface. He affixes polyester chiffon to a base of stretched knitted fabric.&amp;nbsp; An acrylic binder screen-printed on the surface in a pattern permeates the fabrics, causing them to join. Rayon fibers are affixed to this binder, and using an electric charge called flocking, they are made to stand vertically. Then the knitted fabric that had been stretched during this whole process is&amp;nbsp;released again, leaving the double-layered cloth puckered and covered with flocked crevices.",
