    "description":"A plain woven, white polyester fabric is deliberately wrinkled, then printed with heat-transfer sheets in a soft blue-gray. Heat and pressure permanently set both the ink and the wrinkles. When the fabric is expanded, the white, undyed areas inside the creases are revealed.",
    "justification":"Urase Co., Ltd., which primarily manufactures polyester fabric for applications in the fashion, sports, medical, and industrial fields, also has a small research and development department that is experimenting with new techniques and technologies for polyester. This experimentation has produced textiles such as Harmony, which was designed in 1997. It was made using a type of heat-transfer printing process combined with proprietary manufacturing processes. A plain woven, white polyester fabric is deliberately wrinkled, then printed with heat-transfer sheets in a soft blue-gray, and the heat and pressure permanently set both the ink and the wrinkles. This process ultimately transforms a static piece of polyester into a dynamic surface, which can be most vividly seen when the wrinkles are pulled apart revealing another color, that of the original fabric ground, underneath.&amp;nbsp; ",
