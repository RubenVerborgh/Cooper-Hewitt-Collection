    "description":"An interior view of a salon, identified as Queen Victoria's private sitting room, shows a semicircular alcove at right and a fireplace at left. French windows, shaded by striped awnings, lead on to a balcony.  A sense of intimacy is conveyed by the slipcovered furniture, most prominently an English form of a tete-a-tete, viewed from behind, and a draped piano at lower right. The facing wall and that on the left are hung with portrait paintings in elaborate gilt frames. A central six-armed chandelier is suspended from the ceiling, which is coffered in an intricate interlace design. Tables, divans and chairs are arranged on a carpet patterned in green and gold ovals on a blue field. Various examples of objets d'art are visible: a gilt birdcage surmounted by a circular fishbowl in the alcove at right, numerous glass-covered figurines and classical marble busts. Especially touching is the cluster of children's toys.",
