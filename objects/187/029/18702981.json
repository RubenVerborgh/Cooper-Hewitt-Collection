Project files include drawings, sketches, blueprints, correspondence, patents, legal correspondence, clippings, financial reports, and advertisements for Horwitt's projects.  Samples of logos and letterheads he designed are included as well.  The most thorough documentation pertains to the Braquette, the Cyclometer, the Museum Watch, and the Beta Chair.

Interviews with individuals who worked with and knew Horwitt are included on audio cassettes, \"Recollections of Nathan Horwitt\".  Two short videos, \"The Legend behind the Museum Watch\" and \"Movado Worldwide Museum\" are stored on 3/4 in. video cassettes.",
