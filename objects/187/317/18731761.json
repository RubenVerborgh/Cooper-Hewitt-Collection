    "description":"White political poster with black text. Text reads: \n\"THE ADVANTAGES OF BEING A WOMAN ARTIST:\/ Working without the pressure of success.\/ Not having to be in shows with men.\/ Having an escape from the art world in your 4 free-lance jobs.\/ Knowing your career might pick up after you're eighty.\/ Being reassured that whatever kind of art you make it will be labeled feminine.\/ Not being stuck in a tenured teaching position.\/ Seeing your ideas live on in the works of others.\/ Having the opportunity to choose between a career and motherhood.\/ Not having to choke on those big cigars or paint in Italian suits.\/ Having more time to work after your mate dumps you for someone younger.\/ Being included in revised versions of art history.\/ Not having to undergo the embarassment of being called a genius.\/ Getting your pictures in the art magazines wearing a gorilla suit.\/ Please send $ and comments to: Guerilla Girls Conscience of the Art World\/ Box 1056 Cooper Sta. NY, NY 10276.\"",
