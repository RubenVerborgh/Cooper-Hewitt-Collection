    "justification":"&amp;nbsp;For ten years, SALT, a partnership between textile designers June Swindell and Karina Thomas, has been experimenting with the ways in which materials and textures absorb, reflect, and filter light. Because they have focused on window treatments, they are concerned with privacy, with managing light, and with the appearance of different materials in day and nighttime lighting. Many of their textiles play with sheerness and opacity-- with areas to look at and areas to look through, surfaces which attract the eye and others which allow light, and vision, to pass through. ",
