    "description":"Black horse hairs used end to end as the weft, with several inches left unwoven at each side. The warp is white viscose used in irregular vertical bands. The horsehair is used more or less densely to create wide horizontal bands alternating between sheer and opaque.",
    "justification":"For ten years, SALT, a partnership between textile designers June Swindell and Karina Thomas, has been experimenting with the ways in which materials and textures absorb, reflect, and filter light. Because they have focused on window treatments, they are concerned with privacy, with managing light, and with the appearance of different materials in day and nighttime lighting. Many of their textiles play with sheerness and opacity-- with areas to look at and areas to look through, surfaces which attract the eye and others which allow light, and vision, to pass through. \nHorsehair, a material most commonly used for scratchy but durable 19th century upholstery fabrics, is revitalized here in a simple structure which exploits the natural beauty of the material. The wide bands are formed by changes in density in the weaving, which give translucent and opaque areas, and the unbound ends highlight the nature of the raw material. &amp;nbsp;",
