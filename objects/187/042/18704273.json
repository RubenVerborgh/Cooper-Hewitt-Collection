    "description":"Dress-weight plain weave cotton fabric printed in blue on a white ground. The overall pattern layout is an even horizontal stripe. In each band a suburban street is depicted, with houses in three different styles of architecture, one very modern. The pattern appears in positive (blue on white) and negative (white on blue) to form the stripe effect.",
    "justification":"This charming cotton dress fabric&amp;nbsp;was anonymously&amp;nbsp;donated and remains anonymous&amp;nbsp;itself,&amp;nbsp;as there are no designer or manufacturer markings in the selvedges. It was&amp;nbsp;probably intended for the home-sewing market; many so-called&amp;nbsp;'conversational' prints one were produced and made into women's full, gathered shirts or men's casual shirts. This piece satirizes the post-War housing boom and the introduction of modern architecture into the American landscape. Each horizontal stripe depicts a suburban landscape, with tidy front walkways branching regularly off a street, each leading to a house in a different architectural style, every third house being \u201cmodern.\u201d Although not categorized as a high-end fabric, the pattern is sophisticated and this fabric together 2005-32-2 provides a witty commentary on the cultural scene in the US in the post-war years.
