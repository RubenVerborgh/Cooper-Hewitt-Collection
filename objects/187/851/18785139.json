    "justification":"The Cooper-Hewitt has in its collection seven textiles from 1983 produced by Mira-X, a Swiss textile manufacturer that collaborated with Panton. This group of textiles includes this piece, one of his more innovative and unusual fabrics produced during the early 1970s, Finesse: Circle (2011-36-2), which is printed and has areas of burn out within the printed circles. This process created a semi-translucent textile that when held up to the light creates a very dappled light and feeling of three-dimensionality. Finesse designs also included Square and Curve. ",
