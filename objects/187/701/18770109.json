    "description":"Two panels, one dark brown and one violet, with a psychedelic weft-float weave. The pattern is based on costumes that Indians wear when they practice religious rituals and drink a hallucinogenic herb, Yag\u00e9.  According to tradition, this helps them see and remember their ancestors",
    "justification":"Jorge Lizarazo, owner and founder of Hechizoo, created the psychedelic pattern&amp;nbsp;of this textile,&amp;nbsp;\u201cTurbo\u201d, by employing a polysilk warp and acetate ribbon weft. The pattern itself is based on Latin American costumes worn during religious rituals that includes the&amp;nbsp;drinking a hallucinogenic herb, Yag\u00e9. According to tradition, the ritual helps the practitioner see and remember their ancestors. \n&amp;nbsp;\nMuch like another Hechizoo textile in the collection, Marea, which is a black nylon and copper textile intended as a decorative panel or window curtain, Turbo (2010) is meant to interact with interior spaces rather than overpower them. In this way, the textile directly relates to the work of Bauhaus master weavers Anni Albers and Gunta St\u00f6lzl. ",
