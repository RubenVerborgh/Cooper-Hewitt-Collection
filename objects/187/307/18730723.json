    "justification":"\nSilk Banksia, a jacquard woven silk, was designed by Jennifer Robertson while studying jacquard design and weaving at the renowned Fondazione Arte della Sota Lisio in Florence, Italy in 2005. It was subsequently woven by the Bianchi Company in 2007 in Como, Italy. As the designer states: \u201cThe design is an exploration of the poetic language between silk, flora, and human sensorial experience with interior space and the natural environment.\u201d This is a constant underlying theme in Robertson\u2019s work as she aims to blend the best of traditional and contemporary woven textiles. \n&amp;nbsp;\nSilk Banksia relies on the extraordinary weaving traditions and expertise of the Lisio workshop. Few places could replicate this unusually fine weaving which comprises over 16,000 silk warp ends in a 150 cm width achieving a density of 110 ends per centimeter. The ability to have such extraordinary quality ultimately led Robertson to work with a photographic detail of an image of banksias, which is a flower native to Australia. The flower displays a vibrant movement of stamens and a high contrast of light and shadow. By reducing the number of colors to only five, she creates restraint without losing detail and gains a wonderful luminosity with the vivid orange that almost seems electrified. \n\n&amp;nbsp;",
