    "justification":"Crocodile represents junichi Arai\u2019s experimentation with the material polyphenylene sulfide, a highly flame-resistant cloth. The textile is composed of not only PPS, but also wool, and the surface texture, which looks similar to the skin of a crocodile, is achieved by combining a melt-off technique with shibori and felting. He has been working with PPS for almost twenty years, but it was only in 2004 that he completed his experimentation and filed for a patent, however, the stainless steel color of PPS in Crocodile was developed in 2006.&amp;nbsp; ",
