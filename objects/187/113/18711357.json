    "justification":"Devil Damask, produced by Timorous Beasties, is a cotton and polyester machine-made lace with a large-scale symmetrical pattern not unlike many early 18th century silk damasks. At first glance it appears to be a typical &quot;central vase with flowering branches\u201d design, but slowly the face and horns of the devil make themselves seen where the vase should be, and there may be demons lurking among the flowers. This textile is not only a superb example of modern lace, but also a strong modern counterpoint to a very traditional type of floral design used broadly in textiles and wallcoverings over several centuries.
