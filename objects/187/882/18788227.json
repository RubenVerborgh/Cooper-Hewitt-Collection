    "description":"Model of hyperbolic space crocheted in bright red wool. Spherical form with crenellated surface.",
    "justification":"The distinctly crenulated, irregular and wavy features exhibited in this textile are reminiscent of forms seen in living corals, which are examples of a mathematical structure known as hyperbolic space.&amp;nbsp; The discovery that this type of geometric structure could be modeled in crochet was first made in 1997 by Dr. Daina Taimina, a mathematician working at Cornell University.&amp;nbsp; Her inspiration was based on a suggestion put forward in the 1970s by an American geometer, William Thurston. Thurston\u2019s model, however, was made of paper and taped together, making it inherently fragile and hard to handle. Taimina found that the essence of this construction could be implemented with crochet by increasing the number of stitches in each row. With each increase, the surface naturally began to ruffle and crenellate. The result is a model with a cohesive surface and dynamic form that exhibits many of the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space. Because of the creation of this model these properties are now not only visible, but can also be experienced through handling the surface, making this textile an excellent learning tool.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThis particular textile was commissioned specifically for the collection of the Cooper-Hewitt, and is comprised of a crocheted model approximately 16-18 inches in diameter. Additionally, Taimina created a similar touch sample so that visitors to the museum can directly experience the surface of the piece. Textiles are often used in this capacity as tools for learning, for example, this work enhances the understanding hyperbolic space as a particular mathematical structure in tangible form that can be experienced and carefully studied. In this way it is not unlike the Cooper-Hewitt\u2019s exceptional collection of embroidered samplers, which were stitching \u201cpractice sheets\u201d for young girls in the 18th and 19th centuries, and ultimately became a record of their expertise. These crocheted models of hyperbolic space not only exemplify \u201ctextile tools\u201d, but also highlight textiles associated with women and the craft tradition, and lend to it a new meaning and significance.\n&amp;nbsp;\n&amp;nbsp;",
