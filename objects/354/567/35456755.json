    "justification":"In the wake of the Deep Water Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Anthony Burrill was approached by Tom Galle and Cecilia Azcarate Isturiz, the creative team at the innovative communications agency Happiness Brussels.&amp;nbsp; Isturiz and Galle asked Burrill to create a design for a poster that would be printed with oil from the spill.&amp;nbsp; Burrill was drawn to the opportunity to produce something positive out of the tragic disaster.&amp;nbsp; A few days later, Burrill submitted his design and Isturiz and Galle flew to the Louisiana to capture oil from the spill that had leeched into the sandy beaches of the coastline.&amp;nbsp; Upon their arrival, they found the entire beach cordoned off, but when BP security personnel left for lunch, the team sneaked past the barriers and filled their buckets with the crude saturated sand.&amp;nbsp; The oil was brought to Purple Monkey Design, a commercial print shop based in New Orleans, where the oil and sand were mixed with extender base and a limited edition of two hundred screenprints were produced.&amp;nbsp; Burrill\u2019s poster design features a simple and straightforward slogan: \u201cOIL &amp; WATER DO NOT MIX,\u201d printed in capital, block lettering.&amp;nbsp; Isturiz, Galle and Burrill created a website through which the posters were sold, with all proceeds benefiting the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana (CRCL).&amp;nbsp; The posters sold out within days, and the creative team received a blitz of media attention.&amp;nbsp; A short film about the process was produced by Happiness Brussels.&amp;nbsp; ",
