    "justification":"This plate is important to the history of Blenko and American glass techniques for two reasons, as an early representative of the stable&amp;nbsp;ruby color that Blenko discovered, and as an example of the company's original tableware design that led to its early success. Ruby, a fugitive color, was generally unstable and therefore could not be fired a second time, necessary for the red in stained glass windows that received over decoration of enamelling.&amp;nbsp; William Blenko, the company's founder, patented the formula in 1924, ensuring its popularity with enamellers.&amp;nbsp; The subsequent decision in 1929 to launch a tableware line meant this color entered the field of glass tableware, previously having been reserved for ceramics.",
