    "description":"The flattened, undulating body incorporating multi-fired tangerine color above a lemon yellow, with uneven applied clear glass shoulders and neck, below a red stopper.",
    "justification":"The technical achievements in this decanter design&amp;nbsp;are ones of color and form. The tangerine&amp;nbsp;to yellow effect&amp;nbsp;results from&amp;nbsp;the heat-reactive glass&amp;nbsp;going back into the&amp;nbsp;fire part way to create the tangerine color and leaving out&amp;nbsp;the part to remain yellow.&amp;nbsp; The form results from&amp;nbsp; the glass being&amp;nbsp;blown between two pieces of crown moulding,&amp;nbsp;creating a form that is not only flat, but has the negative of the ornate moulding.&amp;nbsp; \nDone under Wayne Husted's design direction, he has conceded to the donor&amp;nbsp;the involvement of &amp;nbsp;his ex-wife, Betty Baugh, who claims responsibility for&amp;nbsp;the concept, design and execution of this piece.&amp;nbsp; Baugh trained as an industrial designer in her own right. This is her only piece done at Blenko, however she produced designs for other glass companies such as Anchor Hocking and Libbey.&amp;nbsp; The tangerine and double color pieces became some of Blenko's best sellers, produced during Husted's time, even though he may have prefered his designs with straight color. The strength of the color mixed with the undulating narrow form with an irregular surface of this decanter shows a sense of the budding studio movement.\n&amp;nbsp;",
