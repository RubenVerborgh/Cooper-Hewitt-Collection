    "justification":"The austere architectonic forms of these two vases (7500.2,3.2012), offered as gifts to the collection, embody&amp;nbsp;many of the Modernist ideas espoused by Keith Murray.&amp;nbsp; These included reliance on form, the use of geometric rather than organic shapes, and simple&amp;nbsp;decoration, if decoration&amp;nbsp;was used at all.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Modernist design&amp;nbsp;was,&amp;nbsp;in part, intended as&amp;nbsp;a practical, democratic means of meeting the needs of society, and improving life for all through the use of mass production for well designed,&amp;nbsp;widely available inexepensive goods. Like other architects and&amp;nbsp;designers working in this style, Murray&amp;nbsp;strove to create pieces that rejected the idea of decoration for decoration\u2019s sake, and that emphasised the idea of &quot;form follows funtion.&quot;&amp;nbsp;\nWedgwood, established in 1759 by Josiah Wedgwood, was&amp;nbsp;famous for its highly decorative traditional ceramic wares, and commissioned well known artists to create pieces for the firm.&amp;nbsp; In 1932, Wedgwood hired Murray to&amp;nbsp;create a&amp;nbsp;modern line to&amp;nbsp;spur the firm\u2019s business by appealing to a growing middle class that was becoming increasingly interested in design. Although Murray's Modernist designs reflected&amp;nbsp;the precision of machine production,&amp;nbsp;his early vessel&amp;nbsp;forms required throwing and turning by hand.&amp;nbsp;A number of his later&amp;nbsp;forms were suitable for manufacture by&amp;nbsp;the slip casting method, and so were&amp;nbsp;less expensive&amp;nbsp;to produce. \nThe almost architectural, pure form of the large tapering&amp;nbsp;cylindrical creamy yellow vase,&amp;nbsp;with&amp;nbsp;its&amp;nbsp;decoration of simple&amp;nbsp;horizontal grooves,&amp;nbsp;emphasises&amp;nbsp;a rational geometry and&amp;nbsp;a utilitarian rather than decorative nature.&amp;nbsp;The simple form of the blue-green globular vase, and its regular horizontal ridges,&amp;nbsp;looks like&amp;nbsp;a celebration of machine production.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The matt glazes, developed in late 1932-33, have a muted egg shell-like sheen&amp;nbsp;and further&amp;nbsp;accentuate&amp;nbsp;Murray's pure forms. His work contrasts greatly with&amp;nbsp;contemporary Art Deco ceramics, such as those by&amp;nbsp;Clarice Cliff,&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;were highly decorative&amp;nbsp;and often used intensly colored glazes&amp;nbsp;applied in wild geometric patterns.&amp;nbsp;",
