    "justification":"While textile designs were not a major part of his graphic production, Mucha produced a number of designs for printed fabrics between 1897 and 1898 (as recorded in the artist's diaries).&amp;nbsp; All of these were handled by the firm of Carl Gustave Forrer (b.1852), an industrial draftsman of Swiss origin established in Paris at 40, rue des Jeuneurs and in Sannois, 190 rue de Paris.&amp;nbsp; The Forrer firm sent the designs&amp;nbsp;to an Alsatian printing firm, Sheurer, Lauth &amp; Cie and possibly a London shop for manufacture.&amp;nbsp; It is not clear how many of Mucha's designs were actually produced or how they were used.&amp;nbsp; Comparatively few printed textiles are known today.&amp;nbsp; Examples may be found in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, the W\u00fcrttemberigisches Landesmuseum, Stuttgart, and at Cooper-Hewitt.\nIn describing Mucha\u2019s textile designs generally, the designer Maurice Pillard Verneuil&amp;nbsp; (1869-1942) said&amp;nbsp;\u201cHis system of composition is two-part in the sense that in the same design, he combines a very stylized design with one very close to nature.&amp;nbsp; A very naturalistic floral design occupies the first plane and in the background, a simple stylized form completes the ensemble.\u201d&amp;nbsp; (\u201cAdaptation du D\u00e9cor \u00e0 la Forme,\u201d in Art et D\u00e9coration, 1903).&amp;nbsp; This comment aptly applies to the proposed design.",
