    "description":"Shown in profile, turned toward right, with one bar. On top of the roof is a corner of a baron, supported by scrolls, at the ends of the garlands which line the edges of the roof starting from the corners. At these stand blossom motifs; from them hang tassels. Scallops hang from the entablature. The window is subdivided by scrolls in a cross form; garlands frame the panels and make shield forms in those below, showing leaf plants. The panel beside the window is decorated with a medallion with a vase, festoons and entwined garlands. The bar shows two crossed branches. The name is written beside at left and has been erased.",
