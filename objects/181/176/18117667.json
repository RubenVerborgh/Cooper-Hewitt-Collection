    "description":"Horizontal rectangle. The left side. A variation of the altar in 1938-88-1373. The main differences are: the sepulchrum has bathtub shape, with a nearly pointed cover, and lion feet as supports. It stands upon a base, in the full width of the hollow. A cherub is on top of the volute beside. The tabernacle is in the middle of the furniture, without being separated from teh lateral parts. The moldings of the furniture have different proportions. The general shape of teh tabernacle and of its decoration is similar to 1938-88-1374, without the cherub. The monogram has a particular shape. Usual background.",
