Printed in red on a white ground.\nThe Union Forever was printed for Abraham Lincoln's second Presidential campaign in 1864. For the election, which took place in the middle of the Civil War, the Republican Party changed its name to the National Union Party. Lincoln won by a landslide, as the eleven states which had seceded did not vote, but was assassinated just a few months later.",
