    "description":"A model for the golden mount for a red jasper ewer.  This model was supposedly done by Boucher, but it is argued that the putto on the lid is more in the style of Meissonnier, and therefore, cannot be attributed to Boucher with complete certainty.  There is also some debate over whether it was Bouchet or Huquier who engraved the model.  The model differs from the ewer that was made after it, because the actual ewer has swags on the neck that were added to disguise cracking on the neck, but that do not appear in the model.  The foot of the ewer is also slightly different from the model's foot.  The asymetric cartouche on the model's foot of Rocaille ornaments combines foliage and shells that show that the foot of the mount is very close to models of Meissonnier.",
