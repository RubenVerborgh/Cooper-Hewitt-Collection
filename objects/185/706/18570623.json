In the foreground two ships are well rendered, each carrying an identicaly striped flag.  In the center background of the scene, sails and the flag of another ship emerge from the smoke.  This ship carries a flag similar to that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain, with the cross of St. George laid over the crosses of St. Andrew and St. Patrick.  The ships all have double masts and full, billowing sails with guns drawn.",
