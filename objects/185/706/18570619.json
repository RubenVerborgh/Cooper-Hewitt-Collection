    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating three masonry fa\u00e7ades, clockwise from top left:  View from the rear of a \"crow's step\" or \"trap gevel\" masonry building fa\u00e7ade.  The fa\u00e7ade has been reinforced vertically at the center with corbelling.  Directly below this is a square opening from which projects out a square rod, ending in a curved or angled flange.  Marked D (inscribed in circle) and noted as Anthwerp [sic].  Next is a view of the \"crow's step\" or \"trap gevel\" masonry fa\u00e7ade bearing a date marker plate that reads 1580.  This is possibly the fa\u00e7ade of the same building in the previous sketch, but at the opposite end.  The fa\u00e7ade has many steps creating a strong, triangular shape.  A single string course separates the upper six steps from those below.  Within this space is a square opening and what appears to be the face of a male figure in stone.  Below the datemarker are three window openings, and possibly the decorative ends of tie rods.  This sketch is noted as: E (inscribed in circle), Back (underlined), Antwerp \/ Aug 17th 1887.  The final sketch is marked F (inscribed in circle) and noted as: Front (underlined).  It is the view of another 'trapgevel' masonry fa\u00e7ade, though much more ornamental with the addition of scroll work elements that end each of the three steps, in a fashion typical of Northern Dutch and Flemish cities.  The top step projects high and is completed with a projecting cornice cap.  Directly below this seems to be a symbol, a cross inscribed within a circle, possibly indicating a religious edifice.  It is possible that sketches E and F are the opposite fa\u00e7ades of this building, while sketch D is the back of the fa\u00e7ade illustrated in sketch E.",
