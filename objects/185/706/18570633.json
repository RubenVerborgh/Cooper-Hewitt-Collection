    "description":"Vertical sheet with multiple sketches.  At top left, a wood-hulled sailboat is seen in shallow water, viewed from stern.  At lower left a running fountain is seen from the left.  The fountain consists of a central pedestal which is decorated on the visible side by a dolphin with prominent scales spouting water from its nose and mouth, while its tail is raised vertically to support a smaller bowl above which fills with water from the spout above and dribbles over the rim into the large basin below.  The basin has a small, bowl-like projection at the corner, possibly providing water for animals.  The final sketch at right is the fa\u00e7ade of a late Renaissance building with only its left side visible.  The fa\u00e7ade consists of a large arched central pediment thrust up in the center and supported by a continuous engaged column.  A pendentive-like element sweeps down from the pediment to unite with the lower wing of the fa\u00e7ade which is topped by a ball finial.  At bottom right, Roman numerals have been sketched: C D D C L X X I X, which are present on a date plaque on the building's fa\u00e7ade.",
