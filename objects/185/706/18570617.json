    "description":"View of two or three-story buildings nestled in the foreground of a tall Romanesque style masonry tower.  The buildings are crowded together in the character of a medieval settlement.  All have steeply pitched roofs and chimneystacks that punctuate their rooflines.  Only the upper section of the tower is visible but the visible fa\u00e7ade contains two round-arched windows consisting of a double-lancet and trefoil format.  Immediately above this is a blind arcade.  This is separated from the next story above by a projecting cornice.  The tower has four narrow lancet window openings directly below the roofline.  The roofline is broken slightly as it meets the cornice.  A figural finial, possibly a rooster or hen, surmounts the roof.",
