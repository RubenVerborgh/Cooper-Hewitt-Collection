    "description":"Vertical sheet with view looking into a narrow street framed on either side by walls of buildings.  At right there is only a view under the eaves of the building.  The buildings at left are rendered in greater detail, with particular attention paid to the intricate roofline fo the city hall building.  The roofs are all steeply pitched, broken occasionally by chimneys and finials.  The city hall's fa\u00e7ade projects wider than the building and its roofline ends in a \"crow-step\" or \"trapgevel\" gables with scrolls, typical of German and Dutch Reniassance architecture.  The stpes have three ball and spike finials visible, while the central step has a finial that terminates in a crescent moon.",
