    "description":"Vertical sheet with three sketches of details from buildings in Strasburg, clockwise from top left:view of a roofline corner with a slender chimneytop behind.  The chimneytop has blind panels interrupted by a projecting cornice, above which are two round-arched openings on the two visible fa\u00e7ades.  Above this is another projecting cornice surmounted by two gables on either face; at right is a detail of a waterspout visible on a building fa\u00e7ade.  The gutter projects from the building and a second piece in the shape of a dragon's head creates the mouth from which the water sprays.  This piece is tethered to the wall of the building by an intricate s-link chain and ornamental bracket.  Below is a three-story building with a prominent, tiled gable roof and multiple chimneys punctuating its roofline.",
