Top border has dark green and light green stripes. Ground is shaded from light beige (at top) to greenish light beige (at bottom). Background is mottled with green and burgendy to give a watercolor effect of water (?). Covering the entire wallpaper is an irregular black grid and black dot pattern. \nPrinted in selvedge: \"Hobbs.
