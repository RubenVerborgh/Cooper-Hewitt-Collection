On the LEFT, a base formed by a pedestal resting on lion feet; the lower part of pedestal is bossed (gadrooned); the front decorated with a tablet and festoon which is held by an angel standing at the corner: above another \"pedestal\" supporting a vase decorated with bosses (below) and a row of cherubim (above); at the top of the ink-drawn base, two seated angels support a socket.  Above this, lightly sketched in black chalk, a jeweled cross with two angles holding the shaft.  The base on the RIGHT: on a molded base stands a pedestal, the sides of which consist of a volute resting on lion feet and a cherub above; in the lower section of the pedestal, at the center, a festoon hangs (with a shell on top); above this, is a tablet frame.  Above this, a squat \"bottle\" or \"knob\" decorated with an Antique key pattern which supports a circular domed structure, which, in turn, supports a vase decorated with bosses (gadrooning) below and cherubim above; above this is another vase with gaines below and an unreadable lobed element above.  At the top, a socket\/tablet and above that a standing angel holding the shaft of a jeweled cross (lightly sketched in black chalk).  On VERSO, near left edge: the right half of a grotesque.  At the bottom of this form is a hanging pear form with a palmette.  Above this a floral form upon which rests a scalloped base with a harpie supporting a calyx.  Above this is a decorated oblong base from which acanthus leaves sprout ending in a goat.  From the acanthus leaves springs a lily shape above which is a scalloped base supporting a round vase holding flowers and decorated with a basket motif above and a head below. Above the oblong base rests a sphinx from whose head springs leaf-like motifs.",
