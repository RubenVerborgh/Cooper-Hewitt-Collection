    "description":"The left half is shown.  The mensa had a convex plan, with four steps in front of the straight central part.  The head piece has four steps.  The retable consists of a high and complicated pedestal, with the figure of the Virgin praying in front of the Cross.  The wall behind the retable had the form of a niche.  At its front corner an angel is kneeling upon a pedestal, carrying a candlestick with five arms upon his head.  At the corner of the mensa stands a candelabrum with two flying angels beside its shaft, and with a standing angel carrying three candle branches upon the head.  The stucco decoration of the wall is suggested but not entirely executed.",
