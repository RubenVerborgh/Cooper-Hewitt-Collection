    "description":"Design of a ceiling.  In the center of the plan is a circle containing a square.  The outlines of a cupola are seen from below, inscribed into it.  The space of the cupola is filled by a square, in the center of which are the figures of two dancing women.  This representation is framed by moldings in cross shape, with ornamented squares in the corners.  In the panels of the angles of the large square is a centaur carrying a boy.  In the corners of the ceiling are four horizontally rectangular landscapes with their base along the short sides.  Between them are quadrigas, both with a winged genius carrying a palm branch, the left one is drawn by four stags, the right one by horses.  In the center of the long sides are on either side two heads of elephants, with leaf stems.  In the corners above the landscapes are circles with a woman on blue ground.  Two framing bands.",
