    "description":"Vertical sheet depicting a very finely carved modillion viewed from the front and in profile.  It is a delicate bluish-gray, possibly indicating it was marble.  The front view shows the modillion with a large leaf that terminates in a scrolle.  The side view reveals the modillion curved profile begins and ends with a rosette.  The main decorative element is a long, scrolling vine with lacy leaves and a small winged creature perched on the vine.  This section has a large, oblong beaded molding.  The right side of the modillion has another decorative element in its own panel, that of a slender, tall vase with leaf ornament at the base.",
