    "description":"Vertical sheet with four sketches of lighting implements.  At the top left and right are two torch bearers. The one at left in the form of griffin with the head of a classical goddess which holds in her mouth a short flange that ends in a large round bobeche.   The one at right is a similar form, but instead is a  horned dragon with its spiny wing extended, and it holds a different bobeche in its mouth.  Below center is a large iron lamp in the form of a small building.  Three columns support an entablature from which three very large curved spikes rise from the corners.  The two sides that are visible have a double lancet opening and panels below.  To the right of this drawing is the bracket that supports the lamp, decorated with a lion, banner, modillions, and rosettes.  The drawings are all tinted a pinkish-gray.",
