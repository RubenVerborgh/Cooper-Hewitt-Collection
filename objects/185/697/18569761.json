    "description":"Vertical sheet depicting in great detail an iron gate.  The center of the gate is composed of lattice strips of iron.  Above and below are four square panels, though only the bottom right panel contains an openwork rosette, though it is possible that the artist implies that this is repeated both above and below. The gate has a long latch with notches at the bottom so that it can be made shorter or longer.  The latch has a small detail of a head at the end.  In the margin of the sheet are fuller renderings of details only sketched in the larger drawing.  These are a rosette; a figural nailhead seen from the front and in profile;  the side of a bracket; a section of one of the lattice pieces; a section through the door at the bottom; another figural nailhead; and other details of the ornament.",
