    "description":"Vertical sheet tipped horizontally into binding, divided into two halves.  The upper half of the sheet depicts an ironwork gate, while the lower half depicts a section of a balcony.  A corner of the gate is illustrated, showing a horizontal and vertical member intersected and an iron mesh in the center.  The links of iron have been cross-hatched, giving the impression that the metal was braided.  The top of the gate has three groups of three spiky projections.  The metal of the gate is rendered in slate blue. The drawing below shows what could be a section of the architrave of a balcony.  The lower portion has a frieze of shells inscribed in circles.  The field around the shells is bright yellow with crazed lines, mimicking a crackled surface.  Above this is another frieze separted by a beaded course.  The frieze alternates larger shells (almost like anthemion) with the heads of cherubs.  The heads are encircled by halo-like spheres.  The spheres alternate sections of three gold dots and a strip of color, as shown here, either green or blue.",
