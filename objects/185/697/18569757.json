Many of the drawings for ironwork are reddish-gray, as if to indicate rust or patina.  Two types of ironwork (possibly used for hitching a horse?) are shown from the front and in profile  There is another small ring at upper right shown in a three-quarter view and also from the side.  Many of the sketches bear notations about their scale.",
