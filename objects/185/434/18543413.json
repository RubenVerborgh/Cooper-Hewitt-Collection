    "description":"Design of a ceiling.  One quarter of the design is shown.  In the center is a tent cupola shown from below.  It is supported at four corners by bucrania and in the middle of the curved sides by winged female half-figures, who are on top of an arch which is supported by two satyr gaines.  In the center of the cupola is a panel with a sphere supported by four children.  A few grotesque motifs are in the remaining panels.  From the bucrania hang festoons, the other ends of which are held by women who stand near the geines.  Below the bucrania are sitting figures of gods; shown are Zeus and Ares.  Outside are framing panels of different shapes.",
