    "description":"Vertical sheet consisting of sketches in three registers.  At top of sheet, four tie rod ends of various configurations are depicted, one from the front and in profile.  As the artist's inscription indicates, these are \"Ties\" from \"Dordricht\".  The ties are medieval in style, consisting of a long spike with a square join in the center. The spike splits into a Y, with the ends terminating in small openwork crockets.  In the center register from left is another, longer tie rod end, a well developed sketch of a mill seen in profile from the left, and a small riverboat.  At the bottom half of the sheet are depicted from left another riverboat that is larger and with more rigging visible than that illustrated above, and another mill seen from the rear.",
