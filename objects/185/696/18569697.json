To the right of this is a lightly sketched timber structure with a prominent dormer and roof with deep eaves visibly supported by beams from underneath.  Below this drawing is another half-timber and plaster stucture identified as a \"farm house\".  At bottom right is a large half-timbered building with masonry lower story and a low, swooping wooden eave supported by y-shaped timbers at the front.  A smaller timber structure with steeply pitched roof is attached to the rear.",
