The house consists of three stories at one corner - the elevation is articulated by projecting stringcourses and terminates in a 'trapgevel' fa\u00e7ade.  Adjacent at the ground level are two windows, one with a shutter hanging askew from its hinge.  At this corner of the house, one section up to the second story has been removed to create a round-arched entrance.",
