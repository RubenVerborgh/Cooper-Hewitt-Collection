It being very \/ hot today I saw many unable to go further \/ so tired were they - when the carts stop the dogs \/ lie down to rest - when it is time to go \/ on the driver sits on the other end of the cart \/ thus lifting the dogs to their feet. \/ Roads and streets are all bricked with small \/ bricks - \/ Distances are measured entirely by time \/ for instance no body knows how many miles \/ or meters it is from Enkhuizen to \/ Floom but it is 3 1\/2 hours, \"and no mistake.\"  [note: words in quotations were underlined by the artist for emphasis];\n\nbow \/ riverboat \/ stern\n\nThis is a good \/ chain to put between posts as it is \/ impossible to sit on it. \n\n(inscribed in circle): 20; 22\n\nThese windows over 45 or 50 ft. high \/ tracery all of brick -  no stone \/ the carvings in this church are \/ superb dating from 1512-1600.\n\nNotes (underlined) Aug 21st and 22nd 1887\n\ndate",

    "description":"Six sketches arranged on a vertical sheet. At top left a wood-hulled riverboat is viewed from the side, and also from the bow and stern.  Below this is a sketch of the date 1600, the numerals formed by  pieces of ironwork with prominent joints.  To the right, a late Gothic style tracery window which the artist notes was created with brick and not stone.  Above at right are two sketches of a chain with ring- and diamond-shaped links.  The diamond-shaped links have spiked projections on either flat side of the link, making it, as the artist notes, difficult upon which to sit.",
