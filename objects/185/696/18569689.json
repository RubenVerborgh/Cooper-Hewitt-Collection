    "description":"Vertical sheet with two sketches of buildings.  At left is a half-timbered building with a shingled or tiled steeply pitched roof that has a very deep overhang.  The building is raised up on tall timber supports that create a framed archway beneath the first story, which has a white fa\u00e7ade and two windows with green shutters.  The sketch at right is possibly the same building seen at lower right in 1943-51-127.  It is a long building also with a steeply pitched shingled or tiled roof that is canted at the end.  A clock face is visible in a triangular roof dormer.  Above this is a bell-shaped cupola surmounting a very thin structure.  The cupola has a tall finial with ball and weathervane ornament.",
