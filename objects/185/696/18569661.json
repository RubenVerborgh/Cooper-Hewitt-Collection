The road bends to the right, and lining the street at left are multi-story half-timbered structures, their second stories overhanging deeply and supported by larger wooden brackets.  Many have their shutters open, and the upper story windows shielded by a canopy when the shutters are not present.  The roofs are steeply pitched and lined with tiles.  At the bottom of the sheet, the artist has given a guide for colors seen here.",
