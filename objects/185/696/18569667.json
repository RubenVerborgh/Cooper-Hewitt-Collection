    "description":"Vertical sheet depicting three sketches of architectural details.  At left, a slender tower with octagonal domed cupola rises from a tiled roof.  Adjacent to the base of the tower is a cross seen in a three-quarter view.  The tower consists of two repeated sections: an arcade topped by an octagonal dome, that is surmounted by a tall finial with a ball and weathervane.  According to the artist's inscription, the cupola is made of \"black slate \/ and wood \/ painted black.\"  At upper right is a very low dormer over a window that breaks the tiled roofline of, as the artist notes, a \"convent \/ Baden.\"  Below right is the detailed sketch of a two-story dormer with glazed window and half-timbering decoration on the facade.  The artist notes that in the \"top window there is a swinging oak bracket \/ for handing things up with.\"",
