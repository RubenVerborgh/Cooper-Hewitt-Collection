    "description":"Vertical sheet illustrating a walkway that leads to a large, pointed arch opening in a massive masonry city gate.  Above the entrance is another pointed arch lancet window with four glazed panels. Rusticated quoins define the openings of both arches.  At the same height as this window are two turrets with octagonal domes and ball finials.  A clock is seen at the top of the fa\u00e7ade, and behind it, the steeply  pitched roofs of the various towers on the other side of the gate.  The gate seems to straddle a water source, as the road rises in the center from the grass alongside, and a road or pathway is raised up on supports perpendicular to the gate.",
