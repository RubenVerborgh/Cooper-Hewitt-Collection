Verses fill the space on either side: \n\nAbstain from all appearance of evil\n\nFor the son of man is to come to save that which was lost\n\nVerily verily I say unto you he that believeth in me shall have everlasting life\n\nProve all things hold fast that which is good\n\nThere remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God\n\nFor the kingdom of God is not in word but in power\n\nSeek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near\n\nWith an inscription in the lower right corner.",
