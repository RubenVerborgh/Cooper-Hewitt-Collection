    "description":"Like all Beaux-Arts trained architects of his generation, Warren learned his art by sketching and painting, especially during his travels through Holland, northern France, Germany, and Italy. Though familiar with the key monuments of Europe, Warren seemed more interested in ordinary structures, and began building a visual library of details that would make up his visual vocabulary. To him, a foundation in drawing was essential for an architect. His drawings, such as this one of a bell tower, or campanile, in Chiaravalle, near Milan, Italy, expressed the experimental and romantic quality that would later appear in his works.",
