    "description":"Design for a wall.  The door is located near the left edge.  It has a molded frame in marble color.  Below, the wall has a dado, above an entablature with a frieze which is decorated with festoons supported by knots, palmettes, and at the most prominent parts by displayed eagles.  A line indicates the corner formed by the entrance wall and the one adjoining at right.  The wall is covered with panels, which hold pictures.  One and a half panels with pictures is visible (cut off on the right hand side).  On both panels, the pictures are arranged in similar fashion.   The three paintings in the middle row depict, from top to bottom, a scene of sacrifice, landscape, and dance.  Corner pictures are in oval shape and they depict architectural structures.  Four small panels between them show figures in costumes.  Above the door is a landscape.",
