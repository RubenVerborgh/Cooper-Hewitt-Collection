    "description":"The present photograph features a telephone in the streamline style. The narrow rectangular base supports a rotary dial in the center, and on each side, a raised, rounded terminal designed to cradle the receiver. Parallel to the base is a ribbed bar attached on both ends to the tops of the spherical objects which serve as the mouth and ear pieces. One rib, longer than the others, curves over the smaller end piece where a short piece of the attached cord is visible. Highlights and shadows in the photograph emphasize the sleek and compact design of the instrument.",
