    "description":"A box, which appears to be fabricated of paper and is shaped like a cigarette package, is placed on the diagonal on a ribbed fabric background. The front, which faces the viewer, features a design of three vertical lines placed at equal intervals between the top and bottom edges. Jewel-like terminals positioned at the tops of  the verticals extend about one quarter of the way downward. The block capitals of the product name, Arab, are interspersed between the verticals. The front surface of the box is brightly lighted, while highlights alternate with dark shadows on the box top and the ribbed surface.",
