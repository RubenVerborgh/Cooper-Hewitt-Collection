The round screw-on jar lid, centered within the rim, is imprinted in the same type, in a circular format, Golden Blossom Honey; additional type encircles the product name, and Genuine\/ natural honey\/ 100& pure is imprinted in hand-lettered style type in the center. The jar is posed in the center of the photograph on a textured carpet. Light bounces off the surface, particularly under the label and on the right side of the rim.",
