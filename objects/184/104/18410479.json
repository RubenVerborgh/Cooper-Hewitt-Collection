    "description":"In the present black and white photograph, the page is divided by a diagonal line stretching from the lower left hand corner toward the upper right hand corner, ending about an inch below that corner. The featured object, a metal doorknob, is placed on the left in the upper half, which is shaded in tones of gray; the object casts a shadow on the left. Light is reflected in the shiny surface of the doorknob, a streamlined circular object set in a square base. The lower half of the page is black.",
