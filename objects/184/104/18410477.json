    "description":"The present object, here stored flat, is a label designed to encircle a can of luncheon meat. All type is imprinted in white on a pale purple background. Below a narrow strip at the top, imprinted with the manufacturer's name, Arbogast & Bastian Inc, is A Suggestion for Serving, heading each of two side by side identical photographs of a platter comprised of four sausages on a bed of a green leafy vegetable garnished with four radishes. A & B, in block serif-style, is superimposed on the photograph at the center. In the lower half, the label continues: Old Fashioned [antique type]\/ Country Style [serif style]\/ Pork Sausages [serif-style, bold], followed by three lines of additional product information. Between the photographs, perpendicular to the horizontal type, are five lines of type headed Serving Suggestions.",
