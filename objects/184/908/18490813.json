    "description":"Huipil made from three lengths of fabric, and each length has four selvages. The selvages are stitched together to fashion the garment with small holes remaining for the arms. Purple warp stripes are present on the edges of all three lengths. The wider central panel is patterned on one side with small animals and birds in white and purple. Center panel also has two groups of supplementary warps that are set into the middle of the fabric. Neck slit was made during the weaving process. Both ends of the supplementary warps create fringe about 2.5 inches from the bottom edge of the garment. Neck opening reinforced by widely spaced button hole stitches. Purple dye known as caracol is made from shellfish native to the Pacific coast of Mexico. Very rare.",
