    "description":"This is a view of a male head positioned downward on the shoulders. Moderately heavy lines define the facial features: eyebrows slanting upward and meeting at the nose; eyes looking downward; in the forehead, a curved, v-shaped furrow jutting out from a straight, long nose; closed mouth; and widely spaced strands of hair hanging down to shoulder length. The downward position of the head results in the chin line thrusting into the neck, which is hidden by a pointed shirt collar. Top and bottom horizontal lines and a vertical line on the left frame the head.",
