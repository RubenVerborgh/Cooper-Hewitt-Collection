    "description":"In the present view of a male head turning left, the predominant feature is his short, curly, full beard, which contrasts with the wisps of hair on the top of the head. The partially open eyes are shielded by a unibrow, curved downward over the nose. The combined curved, dark line in the center of the mouth; furrows in the center of the forehead; and dark rims surrounding the eyes evoke cunning or wariness.",
