    "description":"In the upper half of the page, left, this frontal view shows a woman whose heavily-rimmed almond-shaped eyes, under almost perfectly horizontal brows, look directly at the viewer. Her nose is depicted as a columnar shape, flanked at the bottom by circles  signifying nostrils. Her full lips are closed. A headband or hat in a semi-circular shape, following the contours of the head, appears above her forehead. No hair is visible other than strands on both sides, beginning at eye level and extending to mid-neck.",
