    "description":"This cover design for a book jacket of A Child's History of Rome features an episode in the myth of the founding of Rome. The design is set within top, bottom and side margins. The illustration, centered in the lower half of the page, depicts the she-wolf nursing the twins, Romulus and Remus. Detailed triangular shapes and diagonal lines combine to evoke the she-wolf's fur coat, while the shapes of the infants beneath the animal are merely suggested. \n\nThe upper half of the page is composed of type: A Child's\/ History\/ of Rome (in upper case serif-style)\/ To The Founding of the Empire (miniaturized version of the same)\/ By Gordon King (mid-sized version). Below the illustration, Doubleday Doran, Inc. completes the design.",
