    "description":"The head turns toward the left and tilts upward. The curly edge of the thick head of hair frames the face, beginning above the left eyebrow and extending across and above the forehead, then down behind the shoulder on the right.  The eyes, following the upward tilt of the head, glance as far left as possible. The mouth is slightly open and unsmiling above the sharp chin line.  Delicate shading in the right cheek suggests a high cheekbone.",
