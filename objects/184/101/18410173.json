    "description":"A high forehead; long nose turned upward at the tip; full, closed lips and rounded chin comprise the profile outline. A curve forms the eyebrow above an empty eye socket and shading in that area and just below emphasizes the contour of a high cheekbone. A few strands of ear-length wavy hair frame the face on the right. A scrolling pattern suggests a necklace. A curved line slanting downward on the left depicts the shoulder.\n\nIn the lower left-hand corner is an incomplete inscription in lower case: ...aces such\/ ...g adult life.",
