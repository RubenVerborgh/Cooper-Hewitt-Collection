    "description":"Two floor lamps are positioned next to each other on the page. The lamp in the center has a shade in an inverted bell shape and is probably fabricated of opaque or translucent white glass. The narrow twist-patterned shaft appears to be metallic. To the right, the second lamp has a patterned shade, probably fabricated of multi-colored glass pieces or of colorless etched glass. The convex shape of the shade on the underside is broken in the center, where a horizontal piece has two attached, side-by-side light pulls. The narrow shaft, which appears to be metallic, is unadorned except for a small piece toward the bottom.",
