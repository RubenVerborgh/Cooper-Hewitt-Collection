    "description":"The profile outline depicts a high forehead, straight nose, curved lips and rounded chin, ending abruptly in a vertical straight line for the neck. The hair is composed of wavy lines on the top of the head and framing the face. Two coils, one atop the other, are superimposed on the hair toward the back of the head. The curved line of the eyebrow continues downward in an unbroken line, ending at the nostril. Although not identified, the subject appears to be Zita Johann; on the bottom left are the initials Z J .\n\nIn the upper right hand corner is a sketch of a female in left profile; underneath, are several capital letters and swirls.",
