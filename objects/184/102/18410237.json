    "description":"The present head-and-shoulders view in left profile features a female with wide forehead, straight nose, full lips and rounded chin. The eyebrow is formed by an upward curve and the lower eyelid slants upward. Ringlets frame the face on the right, ending above chin level, while a few strands of wavy hair fall on the forehead on the left. The long neck, upwardly curved left shoulder, and low scalloped-edged neckline complete the design.",
