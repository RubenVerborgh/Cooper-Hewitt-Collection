    "description":"In this frontal view of a woman, a thin, dark outline begins at the inner tip of the eyebrows on both sides and continues downward, outling the entire face. A somewhat sinister expression is created by aditional dark, thin lines slanted upward from the corners of the mouth to the sides of the face and downward from the inner corners of the eyes to the cheekbones; the heavy-lidded eyes enhance this expression. Short, unruly waves of hair spring to the side from the top of the head on the right, and long waves hang to the shoulders on both sides. A choker encircles the neck. Lettering is inscribed near, but aborted by, the top and bottom edges.",
