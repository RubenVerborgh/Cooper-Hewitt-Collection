    "description":"Recto:\n\nThis frontal view of a man's head is darkly outlined, as well as shaded in parallel lines and crosshatches throughout. The almost-closed eyes and full, closed lips stand out. \n\nVerso:\n\nIn this view of a woman facing front and slightly left, the face is round. Straight brows; eyes looking down under heavy lashes; columnar nose ending in smudged nostrils; and full, closed lips comprise the features. Sparse wavy lines form the shoulder length hair. Shading on the right enhances the delicacy of the features. Next to the face on the right are two intertwined letters S.",
