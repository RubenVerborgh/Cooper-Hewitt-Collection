    "description":"The design comprises four spiky leaves (or feathers) rising from an arrangement of three downward-curving stems, each bearing tripartite leaves and two berries, one on each side of the stem. Additional, less finished, stem-and-berry formations appear to the left and right of the spikes. The color scheme is comprised of black, dabbed with pinkish-brown (which appears to have faded from a brighter hue) for the spikes; green for the leaves; and the same pinkish-brown for the berries.",
