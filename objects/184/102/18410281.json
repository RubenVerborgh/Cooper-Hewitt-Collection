    "description":"The present design incorporates features associated with portrayals of Cleopatra in Egyptian art: a curved asp sits on the forehead; the headdress, comprised of three layers, is rounded at the back of the head, has vertical extensions beginning underneath the ear and falling straight downward over the shoulder, and is topped by a large disk. The features - thin, straight nose; full mouth; rounded chin - are not, however, in the Egyptian style. The profile and left shoulder are heavily shadowed. Cleopatra, is serif-style capitals, appears on the left in the space above the shoulder and ends beneath the chin.",
