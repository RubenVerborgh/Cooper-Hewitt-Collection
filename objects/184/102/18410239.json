    "description":"In this view of a room installation for an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum, a central and two lateral walls sit on a raised platform. The foliate pattern of the wall and floor tiles present in the actual installation is depicted only on the back (central) wall in the present view. On that wall, a vanity, consisting of a wall mirror and shelf, is inserted in a central niche located between the floor and the top of the third of five levels of tiles. A curved bench is placed in front of the vanity and a chandelier is centered overhead. Metropolitan Museum\/ Exhibit appears below, followed underneath by Jensen's signature.\n\nSee 1956-47-81 for a more detailed view of the installation.",
