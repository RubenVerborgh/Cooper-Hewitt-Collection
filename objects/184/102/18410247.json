    "description":"In the present view of a female, the white skin, tinged greenish-gray, of the profile appears in relief against the dark shading of the background on the left and the fringe of black curly hair framing the face on the right. The eye is rimmed in black and the eyelid is heavily shaded. The headdress, placed on the right diagonally from the top of the head down to the shoulder, and hiding the hair except for the fringe, is composed of triangles in tones of red, pink and purple. A green wash on the extreme right shadows the headdress. The four red beads of the short necklace also stand out against the pallor of the skin.",
