    "description":"Under the title \"The Rise of Rome,\" imprinted in capitals at the top of the page, this left profile view depicts the downward-tilting head of a man. Dark outlines emphasize a long, slightly curved nose; just above the bridge of the nose, two curved, vertical  furrows; an eyelid, almost closed; and a rounded chin extending into a sharp jaw line. These features coalesce in a defiant, angry expression. A laurel wreath extends diagonally from the hairline to the nape of the thick neck,  which sits on broad, shoulders formed by thick, wavy lines extending from edge to edge. The whole appears to be in an antique Roman style derived from coins or sculpture.",
