    "description":"In the present head-and-neck view in the upper half of the page, just left of center, a female, her eyes wide open under straight brows, glances to the left. The mouth is closed and unsmiling. The hair, perhaps bound in a headdress, is swept back at the crown. The neck ends in a few sketched lines, indicating a garment or a necklace.\n\nTo the right, abutting the edge of the page, is a left profile view of an androgynous head, tilted slightly downward. The zigzag-edged hairline gives way to swept-back hair, depicted in a series of curved lines on the head. High forehead; straight nose with fleshy tip; full, slightly parted lips; and rounded chin comprise the profile. The eyebrow curves downward over a wide-open eye.",
