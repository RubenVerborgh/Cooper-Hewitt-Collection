    "description":"The source of the chiseled appearance of the head is ancient Roman sculpture; the features look carved rather than drawn. This style is supported by the use of heavy shading throughout. Although the eyes are barely opened, the left focuses directly on the viewer. A slight smile plays on the closed lips. These features seem to signify assertiveness and determination. Just above the shoulders, M. P. (left) and Cato (right) appear in capital letters.",
