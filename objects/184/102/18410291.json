    "description":"The present profile view, comprised of a man's head, neck and shoulders, occupies the full page from top to bottom edge and more than half the space from left to right. The massive appearance of the whole, including chiseled facial features; wavy lines of the hair; stylized curves depicting the garment; and detailed carving of the laurel wreath worn on the head, appear to originate in sculpture. Virgil, in antique Roman style capitals, appears on the right in the narrow space between the chin and shoulder.",
