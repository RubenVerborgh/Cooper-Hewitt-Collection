    "description":"In the present view of a female head turning right, two curved lines on opposite sides of the top of the head and the forehead beneath depict the hair. The left eyebrow curves horizontally, while the right slants upward. Light eyes; straight nose, barely tilted upward; full, slightly parted lips; and squared jaw comprise the facial features. The prominent shading on the left cheek, the chin, and outside the face on the right has a smudged appearance.\n\nTo the left of the head, in outline form, there is a small, full-length female figure in profile, facing right.",
