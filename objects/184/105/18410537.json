    "description":"This head-and-neck view of a woman facing front occupies most of the page. Her eyes gaze upward under shaded eyelids and thin, semi-circular brows. A faintly shadowed, vertically slanted line ending in two dark spots within curved outlines comprise her nose. The upper lip is bow-shaped and the bottom lip full. The jaw line and chin are rounded. Wavy hair, parted in the center, ends on the right in a ball of hair at chin level and is abbreviated on the left at ear level.",
