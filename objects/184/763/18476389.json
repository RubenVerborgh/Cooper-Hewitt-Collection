    "description":"NOTE: component A -  is made up of approx. 100 fragments of the same border, divided into 2PACKETS. The main pattern of this border consists of a band of alternating vertical leaves and arrow heads connected at the base by a system of curls. Three stripes run along the upper edge, while the lower edge is banded by a string of pointed ellipses connected by round beads. Each \"ellipse\" is outlined in dots and contains a sprig that points in the opposite direction of its neighbor. Printed in dark blue-green, light green, gray, white, mustard yellow and mauve-gray on a black background.",
