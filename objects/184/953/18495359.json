    "description":"Rectangular, with rounded corners, featuring raised decoration of winged dragon with long, serpent-like tail that curls and extends up onto lid. Dragon has single red ruby for eye. Creature is framed on right and left by raised vertical bands; their ends curve inward and terminate with emeralds at each point. Above right and left, on lid, and below on lower section of box, are short, raised, curved bands that terminate at a single point with diamonds, each point abutting one of the four emeralds. The same decorative raised bands, two long, four short, are repeated on the reverse, with four rubies, instead of emeralds, framing incised monogram, and diamonds above and below. Featured, from top to bottom on each vertical side is a dolphin, a cloth-draped winged female or harpy in profile, and a head in profile, terminating in three decorative scrolls, the stems of which abut the lozenge shaped, grooved and recessed striker on bottom. Parts of undecorated surfaces slightly stippled. Lid hinged on side. Link attached to back of lid.",
