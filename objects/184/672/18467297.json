    "description":"Imbricated palmette rise from a central point. Other pieces have been added to the fragment which shows parts of another design.  Fragment is seamed in center, pieced at bottom.\n\nThe portion of pattern seen is composed of two large palmettes of imbricated design in red, and purple, with green central stem.  They slant right and left from the center and appear to emerge from a cluster of leaves, of yellow, and red, outlined in black.  Right and left, projecting from the palmettes are clusters of narrow, sharply pointed leaves in green, red and yellow.  Below these are leaves in blue with heavy black outlines.  The whole pattern is outlined in a fine, dark wavy line, drawn about 1\/8 inch from the leaves.  A glaze remains on the material.",
