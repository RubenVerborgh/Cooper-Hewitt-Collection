    "description":"Curtains are composed of several different kinds of chintz, in an elaborate arrangement of patchwork, sewn to a lining of white linen.  Series of bands of different chintzes, forms a total design of baroque character, borders, corner motifs, and, when the curtains are edge to edge, a large central medallion.  The bands are edged with cord, couched in red, which covers the seams.\nChintzes are characterized by designs of small flower sprays, painted and with great elaboration of detail, in many contrasts of color. \nThere is much overpainting as green on violet, one blue on another shade of the same, red over yellow to give orange, stripes of different colors in one blossom, all with great skill and delicacy of line.  The leaves are sharply pointed and brightly colored.  While many of the small flowers look deceptively like European blossoms, none are recognizable except a carnation.  In one or two sections there are parts of a curious pattern showing narrow curving bands, one with jagged edges in red, one imbricated, red, blue, and yellow.  While the ground of these chintzes is white, several of the appliqu\u00e9 bands are blue grounds.\nFormerly part of a set of bed hangings.\nColors: Two reds, two greens, two blues, yellow, violet, orange (red over yellow).",
