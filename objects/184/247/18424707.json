    "description":"Chintz panel with scenic and floral elements in blue, green, drab, yellow and rose on a strong red ground. The piece has a deep border sewn by hand along the left and bottom edges. The designs of the field and border are related in color but are otherwise very different. \nThe field shows a repeating pattern of three sceninc elements: Under a gnarled tree with flattened leaves appear two cranes, one perched on a pointed rock, one standing in a dark shallow pool. A second scene shows a bird (heron?) crouched on a nest, in or near a pool or swamp of triangular shape, in which delicate plants and smaller herons are visible. From the air a bird swoops toward this pool. A third scene is not easily decipherable, a barred triangle shape, from which rise dotted oblongs, a long stem, ending in a lotus fruit, but looking more like a lantern on a pole. These different scenes are divided by blocks of little birds and flower clusters.  Although the design is crowded, the several elements have considerable delicacy. Japanese influence is apparent, particularly in the drawing of the trees and birds.\nThe border consists of a series of large flower heads, one a lotus, and big notched green leaves; reserved decoration in the flowers enriches the design. The bottom edge has a narrow outer border of carnations, artichokes and serrated leaves on a white ground.",
