    "description":"Small panel of embroidery in high relief of a tree in an oval with an elaborate framework.  The field is filled by an oak tree with leaves worked in detatched needle lace stitches in shades of green. The trunk and branches are very dimensional, and are worked in silver metallic thread, now tarnished. At the base of the tree is a salamander, also in silver metallic thread. The background shows a landscape worked in pale silks with mountains and buildings, possibly a monastery. From the limbs of the tree hang crutches, a wax leg, and a censer. \nThe oval is surrounded by a row of coral beads and two rows of couched metal thread. The framework is embroidered with plant forms; in the two upper corners are coiled serpents, and in the two lower corners serpents emerge from cornucopias. The framework is accented accented throughout with coral beads and edged with a scalloped lace, probably added later.",
