    "description":"The head, tilted to the left, is crowned by hair styled close-to-the-head and sharply defined by a horizontal line in the center of the forehead. The eyebrows are delineated by dark horizontal lines, as are the slit-shaped eyes; the eyelids are shaded. The aquiline nose, full lips, and right cheek are also shaded. The crayon is heavily applied to the outline of the right side of the head and vertical line of the neck. Brutus is penciled in antique-style Roman capitals on the left at neck level.",
