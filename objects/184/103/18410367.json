    "description":"The present view shows the head and shoulders of a man, his face turned toward the left. The wide upper part of the head, crowned  by sparse, wavy strands of hair, narrows in the lower part, ending in a pointed chin. A furrow between the eyes; exaggerated, but thin, brows over widened eye sockets with faintly sketched eyes; a wide, bony nose; and thick lips comprise the remaining features. Touches of red appear on the lips, under the right eye, in the left facial outline and on the neck. Thick, black strokes define the shoulder area. Centered underneath, Gilliatt, in serif-style capitals, is imprinted. Just above the bottom edge is an additional line of smaller type, Sketch by Gustav Jensen for Toilers of the Sea.",
