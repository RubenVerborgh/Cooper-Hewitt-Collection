    "description":"The profile outline depicts a high forehead, straight nose, curved lips, and rounded chin, ending abruptly in a vertical straight line for the neck. The hair is drawn in thick wavy lines framing the side of the face and exposing the ear; covering the head; and cascading to shoulder length. A curved line on the face runs from the hairline to the nostril and another extends from eye level to the chin. The almond-shaped, diagonally-placed eye looks upward. The curved line of the eyebrow continues downward in an unbroken line, ending at the nostril. \n\nA curved line directly underneath the head is followed by Zita Johann in Machinal, in script.",
