    "description":"The book's title and author, The Rise of Rome\/ by Gordon King, are imprinted in serif-style capitals, placed just below the top edge of the book jacket and extending across the page from edge to edge, without margins. In the second line, the font size is smaller and the letters more widely spaced than in the first.\n\nThe illustration, in brown, occupies the remainder of the page and depicts a frontal view of the head and shoulders of a man in a style alluding to ancient Roman sculptural portraits. The square-shaped jaw line; three horizontal lines in the center of the forehead; receding hairline; and anxious facial expression would indicate a middle-aged figure in a position of power, perhaps an emperor.\n\nThe book title is repeated on the spine, beginning at ear-level of the head and abutting the top edge of the page. The author's last name is imprinted horizontally just below the title.",
