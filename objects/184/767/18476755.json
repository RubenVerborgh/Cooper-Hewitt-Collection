    "description":"This border consists of bands of varied patterns. At the bottom edge is a band of dentilling below a wave pattern, which in turn is below a narrow band of alternating X's and four-petalled flowers. The upper half of the border is occupied by two bands: a wider one of floral forms enframed by the bays of a molding motif, and the top edging of a foliage background decorated with simple rosettes. Printed is blue, shades of yellow, apricot, black and brown.",
