    "description":"Within an angularly curving border of carnations, bands of text and pattern, women in ball gowns embroidered in relief, and an oak tree with two stags, a snail and a caterpillar. At the bottom, the inscription \"Martha Savage Her Work 1769\" and the initials A.S. between the ladies, with a verse: \n\"All you my frinds (sic) who now expect to see a piece of work thus performed by me. Cast not a smile upon my small endeavor. I'll strive to mend and be obedient ever.\" \n\"See now the lillies flourish white and fair, see now the ravens fed from heaven are, The neer distrust thy God for cloth and bread whilst lillies flourish and the raven's fed.\"",
