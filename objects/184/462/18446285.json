    "description":"Three panels joined to form a single composition. Description on verso of mount as follows: \"Beauties impersonating the eight sennin - Immortals.  Kinto beauty on carp-steed located in center which she conjures a small horse.  In front of the carp, Chinnan, holding a bowl from which issues a column of smoke enveloping a dragon.  At her right sits Tekkai breathing forth a diminutive reproduction of herself.  To the right, and facing the latter, stands Korejin with his tiger companion, the tail of which rises - true to tradition - in a sweeping curve back of the lady's head.  Next, at the right, stands Chokinka cutting fragments of cloth from her garments, and tossing them into the air, where they instantly turn into butterflies.  And below, in his kneeling position, Gaga-Sennin plays with his fabulous toad.\"",
