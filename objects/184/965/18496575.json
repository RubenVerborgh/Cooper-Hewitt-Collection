    "description":"Two pieces of fabric with blue and yellow embroidery of floral shapes. Component \"a\" has a length of blue and white linen five-strand braid attached which makes one inch loops at approximately one and a half inch intervals. The embroidered design is diagonal floral forms and ornamented squares. Component \"b\" is trimmed with braided tape in the same manner as \"a.\" At the end of each loop is a toggle covered with blue silk and white linen. When both pieces are placed over a cushion, the toggles from \"b\" would button through the loops on \"a\" leaving the pillow exposed on the sides. The embroidery on \"b\" is limited to the edges of the cloth.",
