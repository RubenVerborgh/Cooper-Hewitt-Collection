The Mar\u00e9chal gestures towards his wife, who stoops to greet him at the doorway (surmounted by family crest and pair of lions) of  the family mausoleaum; his son (also in classical military garb) kneels and kisses his father's left hand.  The angel of death, holding a scythe, hovers above.  Smoke emanates from censors on either side of the central group.",
