    "description":"Vertical rectangle. The retable has the shape of a niche, framed by two embedded columns and outside by two more at the ends of the receding backward part. The columns stand upon pedestals which in their turn stand upon a base. In front of the base is the mensa on top of a sepulchrum; in front of the frieze, below the niche, is the tabernacle. In the niche stands a figure with extended arms upon a pedestal beside which two angels sit. Laterally, the base ends with projecting round pedestals, either of them with a group consisting of a saint or an allegory, apparently upon clouds with cherubim or angels. Colored background.",
