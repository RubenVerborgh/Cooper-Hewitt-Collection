The three frames are surrounded by a garland, hanging below, toward the center of the support. It consists of a winged female half-figure, standing upon a pole, with two spirals below, from which branches rise. Below, at left: the curtain forms a kind of tent. In front of it is a pedestal, with two animals, shown in profile. From it rise two branches which support the three portraits in the usual disposition. Colored background.",
