    "description":"Coarse cream-colored linen square from an altar frontal embroidered in silk. Design is the Crucifixion with the figures of St. John on one side and Mary with a sword at her breast on the other. Both figures clad in long straight robes which are embroidered in simple geometric patterns indicating textile designs. The figure of Christ on the cross shows bowed head, blood dripping from hands, three red cuts across the body, feet crossed, and nail pierces the feet. Face of Christ appears to be reworked and that of St. John is very worn. Border of curving vine with three-lobed leaves. At corners are winged beasts with tails (wyverns). Colors red, light green, light blue, white. Satin and outline stitches are used. Work rather crude, but strong.",
