The central part of the retable has the shape of a niche, in front of which, below, is a panel with two festoons, above a picture, probably the Virgin, carried by angels upon clouds into heaven. On top of the circular frame are two angels. In the height of the upper angular edge of the frame is, laterally, an entablature. It is curved and projecting at the front, the outer end being supported by a column, the inner one by a pilaster, belonging to the wall of the niche. The entablature projects also to the back wall, the supports being similar. Above the entablature, laterally and at the front, are angels. On top of the niche is a triangular pediment with two sitting angels. In the outer panels of the zone of the pedestals are escutcheons. In the hollow of the mensa is a bathtub sepulchrum. the tabernacle stands upon the mensa. slightly colored background.",
