    "description":"Vertical rectangle. The door has two foldings, either of them with tall rectangular panels above and below, and a small, wide rectangular central panel. The first ones have a lozenge with a standing figure and ornaments for which three different suggestions are made. The central panels frame a wide oval with a figure, recumbent. The entablature of the door frame is supported by two gaines with satyr heads, beside which are two pilasters, back at the wall, panels of which show an upright stem. Similar pilasters support the entablature above, framing the center panel of the overdoor. In front of it is a circular medallion with the bust portrait of a man in antique cuirass; beside it two kneeling mermaids. Above it weapons and colors of a trophy. The wall is colored.",
