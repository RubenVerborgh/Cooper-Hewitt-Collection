    "description":"A palampore or tent hanging with a center field and border, in two reds, blue, green, red-violet, yellow (now much fade) and red-brown outlines on an off-white ground, without seam. The field is dominated by a tall, straight, slender palm (possibly date?) rising from a mound, with a full crown of feathery foliage and fruit clusters. From lower on the trunk spring, at one side, a small palm head, bending gracefully, and from the other side a down-curving branch of blossoms. From the mound grows a slender flowering vine, which divides above the lower branches of the palm and winds, upward, forming a frame for the tree's head, and at the top curving in, almost meeting.\nSmall flowering trees grow from either corner of the mound; the left of the palm is a short rugged tree, bamboo shoots close to the trunk of the palm, and to the right stands a handsome peacock. The trunk of the palm is marked with an eliptical pattern, and its roots are exposed.  \nThe border, 15 inches wide, is a repeat pattern of short trees, and in each corner, a small bamboo tree. The rows of little trees grow from a curving ground line, suggesting mounds. Lined with cotton.",
