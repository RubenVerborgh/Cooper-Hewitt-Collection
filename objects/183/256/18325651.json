    "description":"A gold-color metal cord tying at the back of the neck, has at the back ends, wrapped in elongated small conical shapes, a pale sapphire in each. The ends that are at the front are of larger conical shape, wrapped in small pearls. In front of these are truncated, triangular shapes not examine and described by Mr. Crowingshield, but in appearance gold, with enamelled decoration on their sloping vertical sides, and on the tops of both, a pearl at center, surrounded by three red stones, alternated by three green ones. From these triangular ornaments are suspended two strands of small pearls, each with pendant jewels, nine in the inner, shorter strand; eleven in the outer, longer strand. The inner of these pearl-covered strands has as its center pendant, a pink tourmaline with an emrald bead attached, through which the string passes. The pendant stones on the inner strand have their surfaces studded, the studs backed with gold foil.",
