    "description":"Text in black on brown paper: Qua \/ lity: \/ The concept of quality is very difficult to define, for it is not \/ merely seen, but somehow intuited in the presence of the work in \/ which it is embodied. Quality has little to do with popular \/ notions of beauty, taste, or style; and nothing to do with status, \/ respectability, or luxury. It is revealed, rather, in an atmosphere of receptivity, propriety, and restraint. \/\nQuality is concerned with the weighing of relationships; the \/ discovery of analogies and contrasts; with proportion and harmony; \/ the juxtaposition of formal and functional elements\u2014with \/ their transformation and enrichment. \/ \nQuality is concerned with truth, not deception; with ideas, not \/ techniques; with the enduring, not the ephemeral; with precision, \/ not fussiness; with simplicity, not vacuity; with subtlety, not \/ blatancy; with sensitivity, not sentimentality. \/ \nPaul Rand",
