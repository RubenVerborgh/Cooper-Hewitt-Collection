    "description":"Recto - Divided in half vertically into black on white and white on black, the design features a full-length figure in relaxed posture evoking both a scarecrow and the unconstructed clothing style of the eponymous designer, Willi Smith. The body is straw-like; the hat is worn at a rakish angle; the arms, exaggerated in length, hang loosely; the legs are apart and bent slightly. As well as reversing the black and white scheme, the design presents the two figures in reverse position, head-to-toe. \n  \nVerso - The card is divided by a vertical line in the center. On the left, in the top half, WilliWearSHOP and the telephone number are imprinted in sans-serif style on one line. In the bottom half, the address is imprinted in an ornate script in a curved format. M&Co appears to the left of the line near the bottom edge of the card. The blank right half is reserved for addressee information.",
