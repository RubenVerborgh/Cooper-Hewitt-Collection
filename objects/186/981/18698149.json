    "justification":"A-POC or \u201ca piece of cloth\u201d is a project of Miyake\u2019s which was done in collaboration with Dai Fujiwara, one of the many talents that emerged from Miyake\u2019s design studio. Together they have completely rethought the complex manufacturing process of making clothes from the generation of raw materials through to the machines used and the delivery system, all the way to the fitting of the wearer. As Miyake describes it: \u201cA thread goes into a machine that, in turn, generates completed clothing using the latest computer technology, eliminating the usual needs for cutting and sewing the fabric.\u201d&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nUltimately, the A-POC manufacturing process produces a garment \u00c3\u00a0 disposition or uncut and in this way brings to mind some examples of uncut 18th century embroidered waistcoats also in the collection. Their uncut state represents the process in which the waistcoat was made: from tailor to embroiderers and back to tailor, who would then fit the coat to the client. A-POC differs only in the reduction of steps as the tailor is both designer and computer, and the final fitting is done by the client upon receipt, at which time they simply cut out the garment to suit his\/her preference.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;",
