    "description":"Text page in Italian in a column at right edge of sheet.  Tiitle of page printed, upper right; explanation of how Balla began working in the field of theater design when Diagelev asked him in 1915 to create one set for \"Fireworks\" by Stravinsky.  The ballet was performed in 1917 at the Teatro Constanzi.  For many months, Balla worked on the lighting, color, form, sound, and movement of the of the design.  The creation of a futurist theater design was always of interest.  He called his creations Futurist Syntheses. of which the Balletti Tipographici Prirmavera is a part.  The theme came out of a correspondance between Balla and Cangiullo in 1914-1915.  The syntheses of Spring is a theme that the artist explored in the following works:  \"The Mellowness of Spring,\" \"The Explosion of Spring.\"  The \"Futurist Ballet\" is part of a later period of 1925.  She goes on to explain how Balla constructed little model theaters in which he presented productions.",
