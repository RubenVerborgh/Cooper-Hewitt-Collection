    "justification":"This example of Carnavalet was designed by Fortuny and manufactured in his factory sometime during the 1930s or 40s. The&amp;nbsp;design is difficult to date because the Fortuny Factory continues to produce the same patterns, using the same machines, dye recipes, techniques, and long-staple Egyptian cotton foundation now as then. This pattern was first printed in the 1930s and continues to be produced today in the same colorways. The ground fabric has a marbled effect in shades of ochre, possibly achieved with a partial discharge technique, and then overprinted with silver metallic ink in a pattern of urns with foliage.",
