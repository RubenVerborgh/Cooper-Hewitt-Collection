    "inscribed":"Typed on label, mounted on front lower center:  \"A panel of wall-paper taken from Stone Manor House opposite Albany, NY.  Erected in 1642 by Kilican van Rensselaer, the first patron of the colony of Rennsalaer's Wyck.  Later known at Ft. Crailo and used as a garrison for British troops during Indian troubles.\"",
    "provenance":"This paper was found in an early Dutch home, now called Fort Crailo, probably built by Hendrick Van Rensselaer in 1705.  Crailo is located on the upper Hudson River Valley close to Albany.  In 1762 Hendrick's son John enlarged and completely remodeled the house.  The house was again remodeled in 1783. The paper was most likely installed during one of these renovations.",

The minor arches contain a large-scale urn sitting on a pedestal.   Printed in black and white on a terra cotta ground.  A label giving provenance is pasted near the center bottom edge.",
