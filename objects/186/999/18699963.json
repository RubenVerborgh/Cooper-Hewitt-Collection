    "description":"The ground fabric has a marbled effect in shades of pink and red, possibly achieved with a partial discharge technique, then overprinted with silver metallic ink in an arabesque pattern.",
    "justification":"This particular example of de Medicis was designed by Fortuny and manufactured in his factory sometime during the 1930s and 40s. This particular textile is difficult to date because the factory continues to use the same machines, dye recipes, techniques, and long-staple Egyptian cotton foundation now as then. This pattern was first printed in the 1930s and continues to be produced today in the same colorways. The ground fabric has a marbled effect in shades of pink and red, possibly achieved with a partial discharge technique, overprinted with silver metallic ink in an arabesque pattern.",
