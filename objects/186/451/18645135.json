Printed in black ink, back cover lower half: Until the publication of Jane Harrison\u2019s monumental\/Prolegomena, a whole phase of Greek religious life was\/unknown to the modern world. By studying ancient arti-\/facts and rituals, Miss Harrison was able to demonstrate\/that, prior to the rise of the Olympian pantheon, darker\/and more primitive cults had been the religion of Ancient\/Greece. This established, it became possible to trace the\/history of Greek religion in detail, from primitive rite to\/Orphic mysteries. This modern interest in myth owes\/much to this book, and its reissue at this time makes a\/primary source available once again to student and\/general reader.\/All Meridian Books are Smyth-Sewn for Durability.",
