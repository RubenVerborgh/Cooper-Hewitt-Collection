    "inscribed":"Printed in black ink, left: And a disquieted old man, covered in a robe.\/His face was old as any face that\/Has died, remembering life.\/He trembled in his speech until I might have thought\/It was not he but my frosty breath and the smoke\/Taking the form of speech in the air.\/I do not know what he really said to this day,\/Nor what the face of the god who did not speak was like.\/But I recall the face of the woman\/Bent over the coals, poking the fire\/With moist stick torn from a projecting rock.\/She looked the crafty sister plaining money.\/The sides of the pit were in faint glow\/And one might have said the earth crawled\/As does the sea, underneath the still surface.\/I think that I was assured, for I went away,\/Took off the sack from my cold shoulders\/And sat before the dying fire on my hearth.\/But sometime during the night\/I felt a draught again, and went searching the house\/For a leaky sill or an opened door.\/I found nothing; moreover, there was no wind.\/But there was once more under my still heart\/Bending, the face of the old woman,\/The face of the god and the face of the old man.\/Like something seen through the water they wavered,\/Leering upward. The fire had died\/And I knew no more from the night\/Than I knew before fear had settled down round my head like hair.\/So I seized the sack, wrapped once more my shoulders\/And returned to the pit; there was nothing there\/Not even a burnt-out coal; but I saw\/Over my head the coals of heaven glowing through the frost\/And a kind of luminous smoke that trails\/From one end to the other of the sky,\/And thought I heard voices in the heaven\/198.",
