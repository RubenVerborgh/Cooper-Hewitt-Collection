    "inscribed":"Printed in black ink, left: Leaving me in the square of street lights,\/Touch me to the quick of realisation;\/The opening and closing of a door no less\/Stir in my mind the time of adieu\/And beginning; the parting guest\/Who might have been a god in other apparel.\/And when my brain opens and closes\/Like a door admitting a guest gladly\/And we share conversation over the board\/I would not ask that he be more than a god.\/The sheep may bleat outside\/And in time if one have strength he may go\/Into the wind to find the lost one; or he may\/Sit by the last leaf of flame in the book\/Wondering what might have been if there had been more.\/But now my head is numb\/As the place where an amputated leg was,\/And I only know what I know for myself.\/XI\/The smell of sawdust, sun on mahogany\/Is not unpleasant to nose or eyes\/More than the rose of Sharon in the brook.\/And I love too the look of staircases\/That turn around and round, going up\/Like the helix of the universe.\/There are landings the old hell and purgatory and heaven\/With steps between,\/The swishing legs of women going up\/And the black trousers of professors going down.\/From the top, the well of the stairs,\/The sudden horrible shock for the eye at the flat bottom;\/Railings along which students draw their hands;\/Material underfoot, forms\/Suggested by drawings,\/Inscriptions at various points.\/There are posters in lithograph or bulletins\/188.",
