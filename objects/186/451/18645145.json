    "inscribed":"Printed in black ink, left: Wondering whether life comes to the dead\/From touching sacred death.\/I wish at times I could praise the beauty of thistles\/Their full meed, but who can even record\/The loveliness of cedars and music,\/Or tell what catches his heart in a vise\/When the fingering sea twangles all the cords in the brain?\/So, whether westward I look or toward the dawn\/Whether I consider the bones of prophets,\/Whether I see the magnificent colors of heaven\/or the quieter things, or whether\/The subterranean orchestras play on;\/It is no difference. Nor is it difference\/To me where I sit, what I do, or even whom I love;\/There is only the incapacity of my poor wit\/And the dull drum of my heart in its forest.\/One thing I see, though. This is it: I am coming nearer\/To what I am, out of myself and the pretension of others,\/So that I shall finally be capable of hearing\/Under the leaves a sound, and the clear\/Whistling of little flutes, and the blowing noises\/Of horns under the thorns on the rosebush.\/These I shall begin with at last. And should\/There eventually come, when I see myself in the mirror,\/The full symphony of greater things\/Then I shall concentrate my disappearance to them\/And my phosphorous bones will, be sure,\/Be ready for the whole miracle of life.\/XXIV\/Who are you, dog with a lolling tongue\/And you slaverous, dripping bitch, to yell\/And snap in the streets at the other animals,\/Treading fellows and the sweaty chase\/Down the  alleys and meadows of the brain? Who are you?\/The visions of the past rise and descend\/Like mercury in thermometers, and the souls\/270.",

Design consists of black rectangles made of thin vertical black lines, thin black trapezoids, and red trapezoids made up of 3 rows of horizontal rectangles. Also there are lines terminating in circles and elaborated with semicircles running their length. All shapes are the same length, but fluctuate in height creating a rhythmic pattern.",
