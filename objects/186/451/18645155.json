    "inscribed":"Printed in black ink, left: That stands a little while amidst the floods,\/My heart catches its head in two veined hands,\/And bends more closely to my map.\/Like snail spoor, silken on the grass\/The little tracks of planets trace\/Their shining and their wavering.\/Where is the point of destruction to come?\/Bends closer in the lines to the mind\/Seeing within itself the involved stones,\/Weak granite things fronting the sea,\/Like structures built of light,\/Like towering memory.\/One day older pine tassels hang\/And in the autumn air swing all\/Like treble carillon in a cathedral\/Or as the tinkling brains of kings that rang\/At a fool\u2019s festival.\/XVII\/And now in paradise division stands\/Like two men quarrelling on the sidewalk:\/About them gather tribes with growl and glance\/That one might think they speak of importance.\/They soon are bloody from the other\u2019s fists\/\u2019Til gradually all the populace\/Shows like a bloodied face.\/Mutterings commence, an angry blow,\/Sides taken, and presently the whole street turns\/With ants excited by the falling of a leaf.\/The hill country is not enough,\/The enemy has iron chariots\/But nevertheless will be cut down and blown to hell.\/\u2018The London Naval Conference,\/The Treaty of Versailles,\/Cost many ten pence\/And many an eye;\/One wonders, why?\u2019\/120.",

In lower right corner, a solid orange rectangle covers roughly half of this row's width and slightly less than half of its height. Superimposed over the row of lines and solid rectangle is a vertical row of thick horizontal black bars. Bars alternate randomly between ones made of smaller black lines and ones rendered in solid black. Solid black bars end at right in a diagonal. Dispersed amongs horizontal bars between the vertical rows of orange lines are small black rectangles.",
