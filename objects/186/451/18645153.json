    "inscribed":"Printed in black ink: My memory\/Is old and full of other store;\/I cannot be\/The prophet of what I do not see).\/And then\u2026and then\u2026and then\u2026\/The same thing is that might have been\/Had man not made destruction in his head\/Nor lamented\/An Eden lost or an Inferno seen.\/The stones pile up, twisted and high\/Like questions in the sky,\/Growing from this our place,\/Stretching out to reach a final space,\/To touch the inscrutable face,\/Questing the answer for the what and why.\/X\/But yesterday nearby a cave\u2019s mouth in a hill\/A wolf sat mournfully, howling in the sun.\/And when the stones had crumbled down\/Five skeletons of kings walked out(with halters on their necks)\/With light step, scarce touching the earth;\/And there behind them trailed a bareribbed wolf;\/Over the hill they passed and were as light as air.\/And nowadays one says they smile at stones\/That the Lord casts from heaven.\/The kings of all the world who dwell in hills\/Are hewers of wood and watercarriers\/For all the world now in its pride;\/But yet they bear it as all kings do bear\/Necessity, smiling perhaps at pain.\/Sometimes I think the sun stays in the heaven for them\/And that the tides of earth roll on, coming\/And going for these same kings whose ribs\/Show in the light like wattles of an Irish hut.\/Down in the brain the princely men,\/Though first put down, are living skeletons\/112.",
