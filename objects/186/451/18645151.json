    "description":"Pages 72-73. Left: text. Right: Abstract design in black, orange, and white. Design consists of numerous overlayed abstract shapes which appear to form roughly four distinct forms. On left is thick vertical rectangle comprised of thin black lines. In center, a black razor-like parallelogram formed by several horizontal and vertical black bars. Horizontal bars are on a diagonal. In upper portion of black form are three rows of four sideways \"V\" shapes. At lower right side of design, three smaller black parallelograms form a larger razor-like parallelogram. Behind the three black forms is a larger orange rectangle that ends, at top, with a diagonal. Orange form is comrpised of, from left to right, a thick vertical orange bar, a series of four thinner vertical bars, and a vertical grid of orange cells.",
