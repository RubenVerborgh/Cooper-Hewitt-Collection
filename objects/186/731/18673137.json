Second, third, and fourth sections are split into similar columns within blue boxes, their respective headers reading \"status of your account,\" \"total payments were applied as follows,\" \"summary of activity this period,\" and \"your minimum payment is comprised of.\" Below this is area for specific payment information including \"total payment made,\" the date, and check number.
