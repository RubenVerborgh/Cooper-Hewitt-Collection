    "description":"Quilted and lined bedcover. The principal fabric on the face is a roller printed adaption of two plate printed fabrics, one being the Favre Petitpierre fabric showing the oath of the Horatii, the other based on an image of the battle of Thermopolye. The panel on the right is pieced with a small piece of Jouy's roller printed \"Monuments of Egypt\"  and a red and white block print. The back of the cover is made of three different roller printed cottons.  The quilting in the center is traditional French diamond quilting, but the borders have been quilted with shapes that are like paisley botehs.",
