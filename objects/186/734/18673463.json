Because it will have \/ different aspects and thoughts, like: Why we made typography \/ in my typography classes at the end of the 60ies so and \/ not so like many others.  Why we see typography not like Ruder, \/ why we came automatically to the transparency of filmmaterials, and \/ how we work with this material.  What are my teaching \/ principles. How I make a poster (will show on an example with overheadprojector). What can be the future of typography. \/ What we are doing now on the Computer (Mac).  For what can be \/ this Computer needful.  Why we keep our lead-typeshop \/ for ever.  Why we have so many American students or from other \/ countries.  Is our teaching method the wright [sic] method for \/ the practice.  What is the difference of our school-philosophy \/ from other schools........ and so on... But we have annyway [sic] only a little bit more than 60 minutes and than [sic] gets mostly \/ annyway [sic] boring. Do you plan a discussion? \/ I send you a list what I need for the presentation and in- \/ formation about myself.
