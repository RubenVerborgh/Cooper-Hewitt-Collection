    "description":"Recto - The design features a pattern of leafy growth in tones of pale green on a glossy black background. The pattern is most discernible on the bottom right, where the leaves are dense and the light intensifies. The featured song lyrics (perhaps one stanza) are superimposed on the entire page; the titular line, Talking Heads (Nothing But) Flowers, is imprinted in yellow serif-style capitals, except for Nothing But, which is in upper and lower case type. The remaining twenty-two lines are imprinted in the same style, all capitals in a muddy pale green.  \n\nVerso - Additional song lyrics, organized in twenty-five lines of upper and lower case serif-style type, are imprinted top to bottom on a light olive green background, about one third of the page width. The remaining two thirds of the page feature a yellow background. In the central third of the page, in a curved format, is a list of the personnel of the titular song and of the song reproduced on the record's second side, Ruby Dear, followed by production information, including Design by M&Co. The song titles are listed on four lines, centered, in the remaining third.",
