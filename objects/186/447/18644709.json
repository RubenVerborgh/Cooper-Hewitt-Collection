    "description":"Recto: A photograph of a tornado is reproduced in brown tones against a strip of pale greenish-blue sky in the upper two thirds; below the sky is a narrow strip containing a few buildings and utility poles, all barely decipherable, above a wider strip of brown earth. Specially Priced Maxi Single is imprinted in small white capitals, centered, at the top; just below, Jerry Harrison: Casual Gods is imprinted in pale pink script all across. Rev It Up, in large white capitals, with the two letters of the last word both upside down and reversed, is centered about two inches below the Harrison line. \nVerso: The same tornado image, with added bluish tones and moved to the left, appears. The features of the narrow strip are more distinct and a red-roofed building is added on the right. The album song titles, \nmusicians' names, and other production informatiion is imprinted on the strip of ground at the bottom.",
