Printed in black ink, back cover: Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth\/Bradley's Shakespearean Tragedy has remained for\/half a century the most influential discussion\/of Shakespeare's plays. Not only are these lectures\/significant for the light they throw upon\/the four great tragedies, but they are a work of art in\/ themselves. They represent the full flowering of\/Shakespearean criticism from the point of view of\/character, and when they were issued men dispaired\/of \"going beyond Bradley.\" These lectures have remained\/unsurpassed in this type of criticism, and\/newer critics have been forced to seek newer ap-\/proaches. Bradley still remains, along with Coleridge\/and Lamb, one of the indispensables for an under-\/standing of Shakespeare and of criticism in general.\/\"A great achievement.\" THE TIMES\/\"Far above an modern Shakespearean criticism\/we know.\" THE SPECTATOR\/All Meridian Books are Smyth-Bound for Durability.",
