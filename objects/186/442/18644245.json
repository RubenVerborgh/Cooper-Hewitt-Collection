    "description":"On the left, under the heading Tuesday, imprinted in large red, sans serif type, is a reproduction of a pen and ink sketch on the back of an envelope, torn at the top edge of the sealed flap. A fluted column, askew, occupies the length of the envelope space; several annotations, accompanied by arrows, serve as instructions for the finished form the column is to assume. On the right, under the heading Friday, imprinted in the same format as Tuesday, is a photograph of a finished fluted column, no longer askew. Centered at the bottom of the page is the client's logo: a numeral 2, in red stencil-style type, is imprinted on a white background and rimmed by a red circular band, on which the company name and address are imprinted. Just underneath, the business hours are imprinted in black.",
