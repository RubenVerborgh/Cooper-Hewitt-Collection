    "description":"The client's logo is comprised of The\/ Stat\/ Store in bold sans serif type, imprinted in white on a diagonally (upper right to bottom left) positioned rectangular black field, concave on the upper and lower edges, with the lines of type emulating the curves. The rectangle is shadowed in gray on the right and at the bottom, as if a book's pages were being riffled. The bottom left-hand corner abuts and is cut off by the left edge of the page. In the bottom right-hand corner of the page, four figures are posed as if looking up at the logo: the right most, a man in three quarter view, raises his right arm and points toward the logo; next to him, from left to right, are rear, full length  views of a man, a boy and a woman. The men wear suits; the woman, a three quarter length dress and high heels; and the boy, slacks and a striped polo shirt. Gray shadows extend diagonally to the right below the figures. Underneath the group, Blowups, imprinted in bold black type, heads five sections of type, thirteen lines in all, about The Stat Store's services.",
