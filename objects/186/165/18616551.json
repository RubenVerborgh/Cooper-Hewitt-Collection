    "justification":"Griet Ruwen\u2019s sampler shows how deeply ingrained faith and religion were in daily Dutch culture in the early nineteenth century.&amp;nbsp; Even as she practiced her needlework, Griet expressed piety and religious devotion through symbolism.\nBelow the crowns and initials are two angels holding a wreath of roses, representing eternity, encircling a dove, a symbol of mercy and peace. In the center a line of three animals is repeated symmetrically on each side:&amp;nbsp; a hart, representing gentleness and pride, a dove, again a symbol of mercy and peace, and a dog, symbolizing fidelity and watchfulness.&amp;nbsp; Close to the borders on each side are the Spies of Canaan, represented by two men with a cluster of grapes between them.&amp;nbsp; The grapes represent Christ on the cross.&amp;nbsp; The ladders are among the Instruments of Christ\u2019s Passion.&amp;nbsp; At each lower corner is a bird feeding three younger birds known as the Pious Pelican.&amp;nbsp; This is the most common symbol relating to Christ\u2019s sacrifice.&amp;nbsp; ",
