    "justification":"Traditional African hats are highly expressive of the diversity of the continent. Hats can serve a religious or ceremonial function or indicate the occupation or hierarchy of the wearer in civic or social societies. It can also indicate the marital status of the man or woman. In Cameroon in particular hats are one of the oldest and most important parts of the national dress. \n&amp;nbsp;\nThere are several types of hats worn in the Cameroon Grasslands, and the particular type is an ashetu, or a prestige hat. This sort of hat is generally reserved for elite males as well as a very limited number of elite women. Fitting snuggly on the head, and the hat supports the striped projections or burls that are on both sides. The whole crown of the hat may be covered with burls or, as in this example, it may be divided on the left and right sides by vertical lines of color. The burls are a reflection of the tufted hairstyle worn by high-ranking men of the Cameroon culture.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \nThe Textile department has a small collection of African hats primarily made out of raffia and using a basket-weave technique, however this hat represents a very different technique: crocheted wool with wood reinforced burls. Not only is it stylistically different, but it is also geographically distinctive from other, similar hats in the collection, most of which originated in Zair, today The Democratic Republic of the Congo.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;",
