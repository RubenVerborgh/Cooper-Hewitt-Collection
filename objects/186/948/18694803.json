Printed in black ink, back cover: by BRONISLAW MALINOWSKI\/The first anthropologist to apply psychoanalytic\/theory to the study of primitive life, Dr. Malinowski \/spent many years studying native communities in the\/Melanesian Islands. In this book, he analyzes the con-\/stitution of the family, comparing these typical matri-\/archal communities with our own patriarchal society.\/The first part of the volume deals with the formation\/of the complex as mental by-product of the creation\/of culture; the second, with complexes in Melanesian\/myths, dreams, obscene language, and mental disor-\/ders; the third, with the relationship between psycho-\/analysis and anthropology; and the fourth, with in-\/stinct and culture. In this last, the author sets forth\/his views on the origin of culture, pioneering dis-\/cussion in the field which Dr. Malinowski describes\/as \u201cthe \u2018no-specialist\u2019s-land\u2019 between the science of\/man and that of animal.\u201d\/All Meridian Books are Smyth-Sewn for Durability.",
