    "description":"A segment of a circle. Design for the Royal Pavilion, Brighton. A design for a section of a rug, divided into three fields radiating from an oval center. An allover scroll design of Chinese leaves and flowers fills the large and one of the small radiating panels, the panel at left in solid color. The oval center filled with a single flower. There is a mannered juxtaposition of a Venetian red line with blue infill of a star shape. This is also seen in the surrounding pointed windows.\n\nOriginal album associated with this collection still exists.  See 1948-40-1 accessory",
