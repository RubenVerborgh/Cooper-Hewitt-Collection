    "description":"The magazine name, Art Direction, is imprinted in a serif type on a taupe band comprising the top quarter of the page. Art, in black-outlined white letters, is superimposed on a black-outlined, solid-colored purple map of the United States, which slightly overlaps the lower section, colored red. Next to Art is Direction, in black. A thin black line separates the taupe band from the red section. Magazine, in scripted letters, is imprinted just below the black line in the right half of the page.\nOccupying most of the lower half of the page, aligned with the t in Art and extending to the right hand edge, is a white rectangle framed thickly in black. A diagonal image of a black television console on legs, shadowed on the left, its picture area blank, is centered within the frame. The Magazine of Visual Communication, followed by November 1981, is imprinted below the frame. In the top right hand corner, the magazine price is imprinted within a black-outlined orange-yellow oval, below which M&Co appears.",
