    "justification":"Embossed Stainless Steel, designed by Reiko Sudo in 1990, is made exactly like Stainless Steel Gloss (2002-17-2), where the polyester filament of the textile has been woven, calendar pressed, and then it is spatter plated with stainless steel, except that in this piece an additional embossing step has been added after the spatter-plating to create a semi-transparent fabric with a textured surface. This is a method of production is used primarily in the automobile industry for plating car parts. This unusual combination of an automobile manufacturing process with textile design makes this series of stainless steel textiles very distinctive.",
