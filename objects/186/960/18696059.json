    "justification":"This triaxial fabric produced and manufactured by Sakase Adtech Co., Ltd. is an example of a technical textile or a textile that has been specially engineered for high performance use in a specific area of industry.&amp;nbsp; In this particular example, the structure of the textile allows it to be shaped and molded easily because of the three different axes. This all but eliminates the problems of stress in plain weave textiles because any bending or shaping of the textile is counter to the direction of the weave.&amp;nbsp; \n&amp;nbsp;\nThis textile, designed around 1991&amp;nbsp;and manufactured in 2002, consists of two shiny, flat black interlacing warps and one weft woven from three different axes. The strength of the triaxial weave is combined with the extraordinary strength and almost weightless quality of the carbon fiber, features that have endless possibilities in many areas of industry. Some of the most common uses have been for knee braces, skis and fishing rods. Of course other yarns can be used with the triaxial weave and perhaps the most successful example has been running shoes. With the need for maximum flexibility and durability in sports, this unique structure has proven invaluable.\n&amp;nbsp;\nThe technology for triaxial weaving was actually invented centuries ago during the Nara period (710-794 A.D.), but NASA re-discovered it in the 1960s for use in aeronautics.&amp;nbsp; As an example of transfer technology or one could also say \u201cadaptive reuse\u201d, the technology (including the looms) was bought by Sakase and retooled for a wider consumer market. It is an exemplary textile that demonstrates how old technology is rediscovered and reinterpreted according to the needs of the present day. ",
