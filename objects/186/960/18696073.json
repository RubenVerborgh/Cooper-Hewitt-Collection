    "justification":"Iridescent Satin, designed in 1994 by Koichi Yoshimura, combines polyester monofilament with a cotton weft, and through a piece-dyeing process in which the blue dye adheres only to the monofilament, Yoshimura achieves this intense blue highlight. His knowledge of the scientific properties of individual yarns as well as the dyeing process has transformed a relatively plain textile into a shimmering lighted surface. Thus, this textile reflects an understanding of not only current Japanese technology but also long-standing textile traditions in Japan.&amp;nbsp; ",
