    "justification":"One of Nuno\u2019s best examples of integrating \u201chard-core\u201d industry into their textile making process is Stainless Steel Gloss, which was designed in 1990 by Reiko Sudo. After the polyester filament has been woven and then calendar-pressed, it is spatter plated with stainless steel. This is a process used primarily in the automobile industry for plating car parts. The result is a semi-transparent fabric that appears to have a fluidity akin to liquid mercury. It is an important example of an existing manufacturing process that is used in a totally different way, as well as in an unexpected medium. Sudo goes beyond the conventional boundaries of textile design and relies on other areas of industry for creative inspiration. ",
