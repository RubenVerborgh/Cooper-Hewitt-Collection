    "justification":"\nCircle Square II, designed by Hideko&amp;nbsp;Takahashi in 1995, exemplifies varied experiments with the shrinking and cutting of a triple layered cloth resulting in what seems to be a single layer with appliqu\u00e9d pockets. Takahashi describes her three-layer textiles as a \u201ctwo-layer cake.&quot;&amp;nbsp; She distinguishes the alternating blue-and-white colored layers that comprise the \u201ccake\u201d by cutting weft threads that float above the base cloth. A felting process shrinks the cloth and diminishes its size by twenty percent. The textile is then acid dyed, causing further shrinkage so that when finished the length is fifty-three percent and the width thirty-eight percent of the original size. ",
