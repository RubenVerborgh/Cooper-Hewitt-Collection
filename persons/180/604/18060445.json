Cochelet\u2019s four-volume\nM\u00e9moirs sur la Reine Hortense et la famille imp\u00e9riale detail the queen\u2019s years of exile in Switzerland. In 1817, Cochelet bought Sandegg Castle; after her marriage to\nDenis-Charles Parquin (1786\u20131845), an officer in the entourage of the young Prince\nLouis-Napoleon, Hortense\u2019s son and the future Emperor Napoleon III, they lived\nat Wolfsberg Castle in nearby Ermatingen. Sandegg served as a refuge for members of the Bonaparte family, and Wolfsberg became the center of a lively social circle connected with the exiled court. (JGK)",
