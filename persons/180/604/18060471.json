    "biography":"Not a great deal is known about James Roberts, an English painter who was active\nin Paris throughout his life. Roberts studied there from around 1817 and later\nworked with Neoclassicist Michel-Martin Drolling (1786\u20131851). In 1824, he exhibited\nviews of Rouen and Beauvais at the Paris Salon and became a drawing master in\nthe Faubourg St. Germain. At the beginning of the 1848 Revolution, Roberts went to London, where he painted for Queen Victoria until 1861. The Royal Collection contains six of Roberts\u2019s paintings made for Victoria, Princess Royal, as a gift from her brother Albert as mementos to take with her to Berlin upon her marriage. These drawings include views of Balmoral, Buckingham Palace, Osborne, and Windsor Castle. Roberts also colored photographs, including royal portraits. (JGK)",
