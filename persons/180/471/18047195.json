    "biography":"Chester Gould, a veteran cartoonist, began drawing his most legendary character, the dashing and daring Dick Tracy for the newspaper comics page in 1931. Modeled in the image of the innovative Sherlock Holmes, Gould was inspired to create new crime-fighting technology, including the two-way wrist TV, closed circuit TV police line-up and the engineless car that took Dick Tracy to the moon (both literally and figuratively). Dick Tracy, the first serious police strip, appeared on October 4, 1931.",
