    "biography": "The Deerfield Society of Blue and White Neddlework was founded in Deerfield, Massachusets in 1896 and closed in 1926.  The founders were Margaret Whiting (1869 - 1946) and Ellen Miller (1854 - 1929).  All work was made in the town.\nThe original intention of the society was to reproduce the look of eighteenth century colonial embroideries using only blue and white yarns.  Early on the Deerfield work was exhibitied frequently at Arts and Crafts exhibitions.  Numerous referenes to the work of the society appeared in the contemporary press (House Beautiful, American Homes and Gardens, Mordern Priscilla, Handicrafts, etc.) and Deerfield was always described as the foremost of the village industries which appeared at that time.\nWithin a few years the Society of Blue and White Needlework was using yarns and fabrics in a wide range of colors for their work.  Members of the society did their own dyeing.  The range of patterns expanded to include contemporary designs.  However, the name remained the same and was in use until the society disbanded in 1926.",
