    "biography": "Lanette Scheeline was born in 1910 in Northen California. She graduated from the College of Fine Arts at the University of California at Berkeley in 1932. She also took a textile design course at UCLA and a year of course work at the Rudolph Schaeffer School of Design in San Francisco. After teaching Art for one year, Lanette Scheeline began to work for Louma Prints, a textile silkscreen factory in San Francisco. Her work with Louma was cut short by WWII, when she moved to Marin county, to work in a shipyard. After two years of war she established her own design studio in Mill Valley, CA.\nIt is after 1945 that she designed the wallpaper. She met William Katzenbach, the primary partner for the New York based wallpaper firm Katzenbach and Warren, described in Interiors Magazine of April 1955 as \"Consistently avant guard in both design and technical innovations\". Around 1955 Lanette Scheeline produced a new type of mural decoration for Katzenbach, the \"Tree\" series. She moved to New York around 1960.",
