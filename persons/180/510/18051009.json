    "biography": "Fuchs studied textile design at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Basel and Zurich and worked in the textile field before becoming interested in jewelry.  Her jewelry has been exhibitied in many one-man shows at galleries and museums thaorughout Europe in the 1980s, including Gallery RA in Amsterdam, the Electrum gallery in London, and the Musee d'art et d'histoire in Geneva.  Her works are in the permanent collecitons of the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, Paris, the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Frankfurt, Germany, the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, and many others magor European museums.\nBeadwork is a special interst of Sieber-Fuchs, bridging textile and jewelry design as has her career.  In addtion to traditional glass beads, she has also incorporated such unconventional meterials as tiny bits of unexposed photographic film and chopped up newpaper financila pages into her jewelry designs.  Working in Zurich, a center of pharmaceutical manufacturing, perhaps it is not suprising the Sieber-Fuch should turn to pill packaging for its possibilities in texture and ornament.",
