    "biography":"Edward Bawden was a watercolorist, book illustrator, mural painter and designer. In 1925, Bawden saw William Morris's wallpaper \"Daisy\" in an exhibition and was inspired to design his first wallpaper. Harold Curwen saw some of these early designs and wanted to transfer the pieces to his lithographic press so they could be reproduced  and sold. Bawden designed 14 wallpapers between 1926 and 1933 for the Curwen Press. After 1933, Edward Bawden continued to design wallpaper for the English firm, Cole & Sons until the 1950's.",
