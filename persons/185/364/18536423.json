    "biography":"John Henry Belter (1804-1863) was a German-American cabinet maker. The John Henry Belter and Company Cabinet Factory was founded in 1858 on East 76th Street at 3rd Avenue in New York. The business opened in 1849 and closed in 1867. Because of the small size of his workshop, Belter is also considered the manufacturer of all of his furniture.\nInfluenced by the designs of John Jelliff (1813-1893), cabinetmakers (worked primarily with hand-crafted chair and sofa crests); archives at the Newark Museum. Belter's choice of rosewood for his chairs has been attributed to the Biedermeier period.",
